We hypothesized that regular exercise improves asthma control among young adults.We studied 162 subjects with current asthma recruited from a population-based cohort study of 1,623 young adults 20-27 years of age. Asthma control was assessed by the occurrence of asthma-related symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and phlegm production, during the past 12 months. Asthma symptom score was calculated based on reported frequencies of these symptoms (range: 0-12). Exercise was assessed as hours/week.In Poisson regression, adjusting for gender, age, smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and education, the asthma symptom score reduced by 0.09 points per 1 hour of exercise/week (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.17). Applying the \"Low exercise\" quartile as the reference, \"Medium exercise\" reduced the asthma symptom score by 0.66 (-0.39 to 1.72), and \"High exercise\" reduced it significantly by 1.13 (0.03 to 2.22). The effect was strongest among overweight subjects.Our results provide new evidence that regular exercising among young adults improves their asthma control. Thus, advising about exercise should be included as an important part of asthma self-management in clinical practice.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29835,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Lower Airway Inflammation in Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis as Determined by Exhaled Nitric Oxide.","authors":"[Rumi, Kambara][Takafumi, Minami][Hitoshi, Akazawa][Fumio, Tsuji][Takanobu, Sasaki][Hidenori, Inohara][Arata, Horii]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28848094","articleAbstract":"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is classified into eosinophilic CRS (ECRS) and non-ECRS. The objectives of this study were to evaluate lower airway inflammation by measuring the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and to examine the effects of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on FeNO in patients with ECRS compared to non-ECRS.CRS patients with nasal polyps (23 with ECRS and 22 with non-ECRS) were enrolled into this study. ECRS was diagnosed based on the definition proposed by the Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis (JESREC) study group. Several clinical markers including blood eosinophil counts, percent of eosinophils in white blood cells (WBC), number of eosinophils in nasal polyps, JESREC scores, total IgE, FeNO, and Lund-Mackay paranasal sinus CT scores were compared between ECRS and non-ECRS. These markers were also tested before and 2 months after ESS.FeNO was significantly higher in patients with ECRS than in non-ECRS patients. When all CRS patients were tested, a significant correlation was found between FeNO and eosinophilic markers including blood eosinophil counts, percent of eosinophils in WBC, number of eosinophils in nasal polyps, and JESREC scores. FeNO showed a significant correlation with Lund-Mackay scores only in ECRS patients. Blood eosinophil counts, percent of eosinophils in WBC, and FeNO decreased after ESS only in ECRS patients.ECRS patients had lower airway inflammation as revealed by an elevated FeNO, which was parallel to the Lund-Mackay CT scores. ESS decreased the blood eosinophils and FeNO, leading to an improvement of the occult pulmonary dysfunction in ECRS patients.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29834,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Psychometric Properties of the COPD-Specific Beliefs About Medicine Questionnaire in an Outpatient Population: A Rasch-Analysis.","authors":"[Marie, Topp][Jørgen, Vestbo][Erik Lykke, Mortensen]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"02-Sep-2016","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28848900","articleAbstract":"Background: Understanding non-adherence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains challenging. The necessity and the concerns scales of the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) are known to correlate with adherence behavior in several chronic diseases including asthma but less is known about COPD. In the present study a COPD-specific BMQ (BMQ-COPD) was translated and administered to Danish COPD outpatients. Our aim was to derive high-quality measures of the 2 dimensions included in the BMQ-COPD. Methods: A total of 168 patients with COPD were included from a Danish respiratory outpatient clinic. The Rasch model was used to evaluate psychometric characteristics of the BMQ-COPD and to obtain necessity and concerns scales fulfilling criteria of unidimensionality and overall fit, and with all items showing individual item fit with no local dependencies, and no differential item functioning. Further, we explored the association with disease-related variables and subsequent adherence behavior. Results: Shortened versions of the original necessity and concerns scales fitted the Rasch model and were at least as good as the original scales as predictors of adherence, although only the necessity scale was significantly associated with adherence. Conclusion: In a Danish COPD setting high-quality measures of necessity and concerns could be derived from the BMQ-COPD. The excluded items appear to reflect other dimensions.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29833,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Adaptation of an asthma management program to a small clinic.","authors":"[Kenny Yat-Choi, Kwong][Nasser, Redjal][Lyne, Scott][Marilyn, Li][Salima, Thobani][Brian, Yang]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Jul-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28850792","articleAbstract":"Asthma management programs, such as the Breathmobile program, have been extremely effective in reducing asthma morbidity and increasing disease control; however, their high start-up costs may preclude their implementation in smaller health systems.

CS without medical indication was associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. CS without medical indication and CS for fetal complications were associated with increased risks of childhood allergic rhinitis, respectively. In children fed by exclusive breastfeeding or mixed feeding in the first four months after birth, these risks were not significant. In contrast, in children fed by exclusive formula milk, CS was highly significantly associated with childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis. In conclusion, CS without medical indication was associated with increased risks of both childhood asthma and allergic rhinitis.

We hypothesize that BEC-derived factors promote in situ eosinophil differentiation and maturation, a process that is driven by an IL-5-rich microenvironment in asthmatic airways. To assess the eosinophilopoietic potential of epithelial-derived factors, eosinophil/basophil colony forming units (Eo/B-CFU) were enumerated in 14-day methylcellulose cultures of blood-derived nonadherent mononuclear cells incubated with BEC supernatants (BECSN) from healthy nonatopic controls (n = 8), mild atopic asthmatics (n = 9), and severe asthmatics (n = 5). Receptor-blocking antibodies were used to evaluate the contribution of alarmins. Modulation of the mRNA expression of transcription factors that are crucial for eosinophil differentiation was evaluated. BECSN stimulated the clonogenic expansion of eosinophil progenitors in vitro. In the presence of IL-5, Eo/B-CFU numbers were significantly greater in cocultures of BESCN from severe asthmatics compared with other groups. This was attenuated in the presence of a TSLP (but not an IL-33) receptor-blocking antibody. Recombinant human TSLP (optimal at 100 pg/ml) stimulated Eo/B-CFU growth, which was significantly enhanced in the presence of IL-5 (1 ng/ml). Overnight culture of CD34+ cells with IL-5 and TSLP synergistically increased GATA-binding factor 2 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α mRNA expression. The eosinophilopoietic potential of factors derived from BEC is increased in severe asthma. Our data suggest that TSLP is a key alarmin that is produced by BECs and promotes in situ eosinophilopoiesis in a type 2-rich microenvironment.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29830,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in human placentas suggest developmental origins of complex diseases.","authors":"[Shouneng, Peng][Maya A, Deyssenroth][Antonio F, Di Narzo][Luca, Lambertini][Carmen J, Marsit][Jia, Chen][Ke, Hao]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28854703","articleAbstract":"Epidemiologic studies support that at least part of the risk of chronic diseases in childhood and even adulthood may have an in utero origin, and the placenta is a key organ that plays a pivotal role in fetal growth and development.

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across all annotated transcripts were mapped and examined for enrichment for disease susceptibility loci annotated in the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog. We discovered 3218 cis- and 35 trans-eQTLs at ≤10% false discovery rate in human placentas. Among the 16 439 known disease loci of genome-wide significance, 835 were placental eSNPs (enrichment fold = 1.68, P = 7.41e-42). Stronger effect sizes were observed between GWAS SNPs and gene expression in placentas than what has been reported in other tissues, such as the correlation between asthma risk allele, rs7216389-T and Gasdermin-B (GSDMB) in placenta (r2=27%) versus lung (r2=6%). Finally, our results suggest the placental eQTLs may mediate the function of GWAS loci on postnatal disease susceptibility. Results suggest that transcripts in placenta are under tight genetic control, and that placental gene networks may influence postnatal risk of multiple human diseases lending support for the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29829,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"[Health hazards resulting from exposure to zinc and its inorganic compounds in industry].","authors":"[Daria, Pakulska][Sławomir, Czerczak]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"17-Oct-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28857088","articleAbstract":"This article deals with health risks resulting from exposure to zinc and its inorganic compounds in industry. The main source of zinc exposure are fumes generated during thermal and chemical processes, mainly zinc oxide fume formed by immediate oxidation of metallic zinc vapor formed during high-temperature processes, as well as dust generated during the mechanical processing of zinc-containing materials. It is recognized that zinc ions are responsible for health effects of exposure to dust/fumes of the majority of zinc compounds, and the final effect of exposure depends on the degree of dispersion of dusts/fumes suspended in the air. Since the effects of exposure depends on the particle size, occupational exposure limits have began to be established separately for respirable and inhalable fractions. A critical effect of acute exposure to respirable fraction is a \"fume fever\" which in chronic exposure occurs as an effect associated with recurrent symptoms of acute poisoning. Impaired lung function and asthma symptoms are considered to be the main effects of exposure to inhalable fraction. Due to the limited number of the available data it is not possible to assess carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity and teratogenicity of zinc and its compounds. The aim of the study was to analyze the major health hazards resulting from occupational exposure to zinc and its inorganic compounds in the context of their physico-chemical properties, a wide range of applications and occupational exposure data.

Paradoxically, there are parallels in the immune responses to helminths and to allergies.

Flow cytometry was used to analyze the circulatory number of VEGFR2-expressing cells. The severity of MS was evaluated using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Finally, we evaluated the correlation between serum levels of those factors with disease severity. Our findings showed that the serum level of IL-33, IL-37, sVEGFR2 and the circulatory number of VEGFR2-expressing cells were increased in patients with MS compared to healthy subjects (p<0.0001). Also, there was a significant correlation between serum levels of these 3 factors with disease severity according to EDSS. Our study showed that the serum levels of IL-33, IL-37 and sVEGFR2 may be important prognostic biomarkers of MS.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29821,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Chemical-induced asthma and the role of clinical, toxicological, exposure and epidemiological research in regulatory and hazard characterization approaches.","authors":"[Melissa J, Vincent][Jonathan A, Bernstein][David, Basketter][Judy S, LaKind][G Scott, Dotson][Andrew, Maier]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Nov-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28866265","articleAbstract":"Uncertainties in understanding all potential modes-of-action for asthma induction and elicitation hinders design of hazard characterization and risk assessment methods that adequately screen and protect against hazardous chemical exposures. To address this challenge and identify current research needs, the University of Cincinnati and the American Cleaning Institute hosted a webinar series to discuss the current state-of-science regarding chemical-induced asthma. The general consensus is that the available database, comprised of data collected from routine clinical and validated toxicological tests, is inadequate for predicting or determining causal relationships between exposures and asthma induction for most allergens. More research is needed to understand the mechanism of asthma induction and elicitation in the context of specific chemical exposures and exposure patterns, and the impact of population variability and patient phenotypes. Validated tools to predict respiratory sensitization and to translate irritancy assays to asthma potency are needed, in addition to diagnostic biomarkers that assess and differentiate allergy versus irritant-based asthmatic responses. Diagnostic methods that encompass the diverse etiologies of asthmatic responses and incorporate robust exposure measurements capable of capturing different temporal patterns of complex chemical mixtures are needed. In the absence of ideal tools, risk assessors apply hazard-based safety assessment methods, in conjunction with active risk management, to limit potential asthma concerns, proactively identify new concerns, and ensure deployment of approaches to mitigate asthma-related risks.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29820,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Functional phenotypes determined by fluctuation-based clustering of lung function measurements in healthy and asthmatic cohort participants.","authors":"[Edgar, Delgado-Eckert][Oliver, Fuchs][Nitin, Kumar][Juha, Pekkanen][Jean-Charles, Dalphin][Josef, Riedler][Roger, Lauener][Michael, Kabesch][Maciej, Kupczyk][Sven-Erik, Dahlen][Erika von, Mutius][Urs, Frey][]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28866644","articleAbstract":"Asthma is characterised by inflammation and reversible airway obstruction.

Using enrichment analysis, we explored whether the method identifies clinically meaningful, distinct clusters of participants with different lung functional fluctuation patterns.In the PASTURE/EFRAIM dataset, we found four distinct clusters. Two clusters were enriched in children with well-known clinical characteristics of asthma. In cluster 3, children from a farming environment predominated, whereas cluster 4 mainly consisted of healthy controls. About 79% of cluster 3 carried the asthma-risk allele rs7216389 of the 17q21 locus. In the BIOAIR dataset, we found two distinct clusters clearly discriminating between individuals with mild-to-moderate and severe asthma.Our method identified dynamic functional asthma and healthy phenotypes, partly independent of atopy and inflammation but related to genetic markers on the 17q21 locus. The method can be used for disease phenotyping and possibly endotyping. It may identify participants with specific functional abnormalities, potentially needing a different therapeutic approach.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29819,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Association of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome and Transient Apical Ballooning Syndrome (Takotsubo): First Case Report of a Man and Review of the Literature.","authors":"[Stephan, Grimaldi][Emilie, Doche][Caroline, Rey][Nadia, Laksiri][Salah, Boussen][Jacques, Quilici][Emmanuelle, Robinet][Fabien, Devemy][Jean, Pelletier]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"-","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28868030","articleAbstract":"An association of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and takotsubo is rare.

It is used in traditional medicine for the treatment of bronchitis, asthma, cough, conjunctivitis, leucoderma, renal and hepatic diseases, constipation, tumors, venereal ulcer, headache, hemorrhoids and wound healing. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies have provided valuable scientific evidence for its use. This review aims to summarize reported pharmacognosy, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological potential of C. absus while identifying potential areas of further research of plant.The review comprises literature pertaining to the evidence base therapeutic potential, pharmacognosy and phytochemistry of C. absus spanning from 1935 to 2016 using published articles in peer-reviewed journals, ethno botanical text books, and worldwide accepted scientific databases via electronic search (Elsevier, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Web of Science, Wiley online library). Kew Botanical Garden databases and the Plant List were used to authenticate the scientific names. Different pharmacological experiments in many in-vitro and in-vivo models have proved the potential of C. absus with antihypertensive, antifertility, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-glycation, antibacterial activity, α- amylase inhibitory activity, antioxidant and reducing activitity etc. chaksine, iso-chaksine, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, chrysophanol, aloe-emodin and a wide range of chemical compounds have also been reported. Toxicity studies reveal the nontoxic nature of C. absus at a dose of 2000 mg/kg, however, plant possess reproductive toxicity and can be used as birth control or abortifacient.Reported activities suggest that there is sufficient pharmacological potential for developing C. absus as a drug for hypertension, infections, diabetes and its complications. However, heterogeneity in study protocol and conflicting results mask the ability to replicate these studies. So, future studies should be replicated in line with best practices. More toxicological studies would aid the progress to clinical trial studies.

The question asked was whether users of montelukast, compared to users of inhalation asthma medicine, live longer, and are less likely to develop dementia. A small, non-significant protective effect on the use of dementia medicine became significant when adjusting for other prescriptions (based on the notion that montelukast users on average are less healthy). A possible protective effect was substantiated by looking at the lack of prescriptions as a proxy for dementia-related residency in nursing homes, and the risk of death.The present results suggest that montelukast may alleviate the cognitive decline associated with human aging.

An empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors can help individual children with undiagnosed respiratory symptoms and suspicion of GORD, but the response to therapy is unpredictable, and in any case what may be being observed is spontaneous improvement. Furthermore, the safety of these agents has been called into question. Poor response to antireflux therapy is an important trigger to search for non-gastro-oesophageal reflux causes for patients' symptoms.

Recurrent abdominal pain is not specific during H. pylori infection in children. The role of H. pylori infection and failure to thrive, children's growth, type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and celiac disease remains controversial.

We aimed to determine the ability of a new suggested spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) index in doing that. A random sample of 1602 schoolchildren were screened by a health questionnaire, skin prick tests, spirometry with bronchodilation and exhaled NO. A total of 662 children were included with median (IQR) exhaled NO 11(14) ppb. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using exhaled NO equations from Malmberg, Kovesi and Buchvald, and spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled NO values were applied to identify asthmatic children and uncontrolled asthma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves failed to identify asthmatic children (all AUC < 0.700). Spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled NO/FEV1 (AUC = 0.712; P = .010) and NO/FEF25%-75% (AUC = 0.735 P = .004) had a fair and increased ability to identify uncontrolled disease compared with exhaled NO (AUC = 0.707; P = .011) or the Malmberg equation (AUC = 0.701; P = .014). Sensitivity and specificity identifying non-controlled asthma were 59% and 81%, respectively, for the cut-off value of 9.7 ppb/L for exhaled NO/FEV1 , and 40% and 100% for 15.7 ppb/L/s for exhaled NO/FEF25%-75% . Exhaled NO did not allow to identify childhood asthma. Spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled NO performed better-assessing asthma control in children. Thus, although more validation studies are needed, we suggest its use in epidemiological studies to assess asthma control.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29803,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"The European Multicentre Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration (EMBARC): experiences from a successful ERS Clinical Research Collaboration.","authors":"[James D, Chalmers][Megan, Crichton][Pieter C, Goeminne][Michael R, Loebinger][Charles, Haworth][Marta, Almagro][Montse, Vendrell][Anthony, De Soyza][Raja, Dhar][Lucy, Morgan][Francesco, Blasi][Stefano, Aliberti][Jeanette, Boyd][Eva, Polverino]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28894479","articleAbstract":"In contrast to airway diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis, there has been little research and few clinical trials in bronchiectasis.

Prior to accurate diagnosis, patients with PNES do not receive interventions that address the cause of their seizures and therefore incur high medical costs and disability due to an uncontrolled seizure disorder. Both seizures and comorbidities may contribute to this high cost.Based on data from 1,365 adult patients with video-electroencephalography-confirmed diagnoses from a single center, we used logistic and Poisson regression to compare the total number of comorbidities, number of medications, and presence of specific comorbidities in five mutually exclusive groups of diagnoses: epileptic seizures (ES) only, PNES only, mixed PNES and ES, physiologic nonepileptic seizurelike events, and inconclusive monitoring. To determine the diagnostic utility of comorbid diagnoses and medication history to differentiate PNES only from ES only, we used multivariate logistic regression, controlling for sex and age, trained using a retrospective database and validated using a prospective database.Our model differentiated PNES only from ES only with a prospective accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval =72-84%) and area under the curve of 79%. With a few exceptions, the number of comorbidities and medications was more predictive than a specific comorbidity. Comorbidities associated with PNES were asthma, chronic pain, and migraines (p < 0.01). Comorbidities associated with ES were diabetes mellitus and nonmetastatic neoplasm (p < 0.01). The population-level analysis suggested that patients with mixed PNES and ES may be a population distinct from patients with either condition alone.An accurate patient-reported medical history and medication history can be useful when screening for possible PNES. Our prospectively validated and objective score may assist in the interpretation of the medication and medical history in the context of the seizure description and history.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29801,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Phase three studies of biologics for severe asthma: could do better?","authors":"[Douglas S, Robinson][Harsha H, Kariyawasam][Liam G, Heaney]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28899938","articleAbstract":"-","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29800,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Medical comorbidity in polycystic ovary syndrome with special focus on cardiometabolic, autoimmune, hepatic and cancer diseases: an updated review.","authors":"[Dorte, Glintborg][Marianne, Andersen]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Dec-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28901968","articleAbstract":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is defined by hyperandrogenism, irregular menses and polycystic ovaries when other causes are excluded.

Thus, little is known about the early-life development of the lung microbiome and the impact of external factors during these stages. In this study, we applied a barcoding approach based on high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon libraries to determine age-dependent differences in the bacterial fraction of the murine lung microbiome and to assess potential influences of differing \"environmental microbiomes\" (simulated by the application of used litter material to the cages). We could clearly show that the diversity of the bacterial community harbored in the murine lung increases with age. Interestingly, bacteria belonging to the genera Delftia and Rhodococcus formed an age-independent core microbiome. The addition of the used litter material influenced the lung microbiota of young mice but did not significantly alter the community composition of adult animals. Our findings elucidate the dynamic nature of the early-life lung microbiota and its stabilization with age. Further, this study indicates that even slight environmental changes modulate the bacterial community composition of the lung microbiome in early life, whereas the lung microbes of adults demonstrate higher resilience towards environmental variations.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29797,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Distinct Phenotypes of Smokers with Fixed Airflow Limitation Identified by Cluster Analysis of Severe Asthma.","authors":"[Satoshi, Konno][Natsuko, Taniguchi][Hironi, Makita][Yuji, Nakamaru][Kaoruko, Shimizu][Noriharu, Shijubo][Satoshi, Fuke][Kimihiro, Takeyabu][Mitsuru, Oguri][Hirokazu, Kimura][Yukiko, Maeda][Masaru, Suzuki][Katsura, Nagai][Yoichi M, Ito][Sally E, Wenzel][Masaharu, Nishimura][][]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Jan-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28910142","articleAbstract":"Smoking may have multifactorial effects on asthma phenotypes, particularly in severe asthma.

For metastasis to occur, carcinoma cells first must adopt a pro-migratory phenotype and move through the surrounding stroma towards a blood or lymphatic vessel. Currently, there are very limited possibilities to target these processes therapeutically. The family of Rho GTPases is an ubiquitously expressed division of GTP-binding proteins involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular signaling. The best characterized members of the Rho family GTPases are RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42. Abnormalities in Rho GTPase function have major consequences for cancer progression. Rho GTPase activation is driven by cell surface receptors that activate GTP exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). In this review, we summarize our current knowledge on Rho GTPase function in the regulation of metastasis. We will focus on key discoveries in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), cell-cell junctions, formation of membrane protrusions, plasticity of cell migration and adaptation to a hypoxic environment. In addition, we will emphasize on crosstalk between Rho GTPase family members and other important oncogenic pathways, such as cyclic AMP-mediated signaling, canonical Wnt/β-catenin, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and hypoxia inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) and provide an overview of the advancements and challenges in developing pharmacological tools to target Rho GTPase and the aforementioned crosstalk in the context of cancer therapeutics.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29795,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Sex Differences in Asthma: A Key Role of Androgen-Signaling in Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells.","authors":"[Sophie, Laffont][Eve, Blanquart][Jean-Charles, Guéry]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28912783","articleAbstract":"Infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and also allergy differentially affect women and men. In general, women develop strongest immune responses and thus the proportion of infected individuals and the severity of many viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections are increased in men. However, heightened immunity in women makes them more susceptible than men to autoimmunity and allergy. While sex differences in immunity are well documented, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these immunological differences, particularly in allergic asthma. Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways mediated by exacerbated type 2 immune responses. Sex differences have been reported in the incidence, prevalence, and severity of asthma. While during childhood, males are more susceptible to asthma than females, there is a switch at the onset of puberty as for many other allergic diseases. This decrease of asthma incidence around puberty in males suggests that hormonal mediators could play a protective role in the susceptibility to allergic responses in male. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) have recently emerged as critical players in the initiation of allergic responses, but also in the resolution of parasitic infection, through their capacity to rapidly and potently produce type 2 cytokines. This review will cover the current understanding of the impact of sex-linked factors in allergic inflammation, with a particular focus on the role of sex hormones on the development and function of tissue-resident ILC2s.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29794,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Association Between Sensitization to Mold and Impaired Pulmonary Function in Children With Asthma.","authors":"[Jung Hye, Byeon][Soohyun, Ri][Oyuntulga, Amarsaikhan][Eunji, Kim][So Hyun, Ahn][Ic Sun, Choi][Hyung Jin, Kim][SungChul, Seo][Wonsuck, Yoon][Young, Yoo]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Nov-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28913990","articleAbstract":"Recent data indicate that sensitization to mold contributes to the severity and persistence of asthma.

Recently, proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) analysis proposed 50 urinary metabolites as potential diagnostic biomarkers among asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Metabolites are divided into 3 groups based on chemical nature. For group 1 (amines and phenols, 19 urinary metabolites), we developed and validated a high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC)-MS/MS method using differential isotope labeling (DIL) with dansyl chloride. Method development included the optimization of the derivatization reaction, the MS/MS conditions, and the chromatographic separation. Linearity varied from 2 to 4800 ng/mL and the use of 13C2-labeled derivatives allowed for the correction of matrix effects as well as the unambiguous confirmation of the identity of each metabolite in the presence of interfering isomers in urine. Despite the challenges associated with method validation, the method was fully validated as per the food and drug administration (FDA) and the European medicines agency (EMA) recommendations. Validation criteria included linearity, precision, accuracy, dilution integrity, selectivity, carryover, and stability. Challenges in selectivity experiments included the isotopic contributions of the analyte towards its internal standard (IS), that was addressed via the optimization of the IS concentration. In addition, incurred sample analysis was performed to ensure that results from patient samples are accurate and reliable. The method was robust and reproducible and is currently being applied in a cohort of asthma and COPD patient urine samples for biomarker discovery purposes.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29791,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Linear association between number of modifiable risk factors and multiple chronic conditions: Results from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.","authors":"[Mary L, Adams][Joseph, Grandpre][David L, Katz][Douglas, Shenson]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Dec-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28917949","articleAbstract":"Multiple (≥2) chronic conditions (MCCs) are responsible for a large fraction of healthcare costs.

Findings highlight the need for effective integrated programs to address multiple RFs and chronic conditions.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29790,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Clinical Guidelines in Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: How Useful Are They in Clinical Practice?","authors":"[Bernardino, Alcázar-Navarrete][Francisca, Castellano Miñán][Pedro J, Romero Palacios]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Mar-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28918869","articleAbstract":"-","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29789,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Basophils activated via TLR signaling may contribute to pathophysiology of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis.","authors":"[Masato, Yanagawa][Kazushige, Uchida][Yugo, Ando][Takashi, Tomiyama][Takashi, Yamaguchi][Tsukasa, Ikeura][Toshiro, Fukui][Akiyoshi, Nishio][Yoshiko, Uemura][Takayuki, Miyara][Hiroyuki, Okamoto][Souhei, Satoi][Kazuichi, Okazaki]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Mar-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28921377","articleAbstract":"Pathophysiology of type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is still unclear. We previously reported that M2 macrophages might play an important role in type 1 AIP. Recently, it has been reported that basophils regulate differentiation to M2 macrophages. In this study, we investigated basophils from the pancreatic tissue and peripheral blood of individuals with type 1 AIP.By using immunohistochemistry, we investigated basophils in pancreatic tissue from 13 patients with type 1 AIP and examined expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) by these cells. Additionally, we obtained peripheral blood samples from 27 healthy subjects, 40 patients with type 1 AIP, 8 patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, 10 patients with bronchial asthma, and 10 patients with atopic dermatitis, and analyzed activation of basophils by stimulating them with ligands of TLR1-9. We also compared TLR expression in basophils from the tissue and blood samples.Basophils were detected in pancreatic tissues from 10 of 13 patients with type 1 AIP. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the ratios of basophils activated by TLR4 stimulation in type 1 AIP (9.875 ± 1.148%) and atopic dermatitis (11.768 ± 1.899%) were significantly higher than those in healthy subjects (5.051 ± 0.730%; P < 0.05). Levels of basophils activated by TLR2 stimulation were higher in seven type 1 AIP cases. Furthermore, stimulation of TLR2 and/or TLR4, which were expressed by basophils in pancreas, activated basophils in peripheral blood.Basophils activated via TLR signaling may play an important role in the pathophysiology of type 1 AIP.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29788,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"PM2.5 components and outpatient visits for asthma: A time-stratified case-crossover study in a suburban area.","authors":"[Chau-Ren, Jung][Li-Hao, Young][Hui-Tsung, Hsu][Ming-Yeng, Lin][Yu-Cheng, Chen][Bing-Fang, Hwang][Perng-Jy, Tsai]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Dec-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28922715","articleAbstract":"The effects of fine particles (PM2.5) on asthma have been widely confirmed by epidemiological research studies. However, a limited number of studies have investigated the relationship between exposure to different PM2.5 components and asthma. We characterized the PM2.5 components in a suburban site of central Taiwan and conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study to elaborate the effects of daily concentration of each PM2.5 component on asthma outpatient visits. We retrieved asthma outpatient claims for individuals less than 20 years old with a residential address in the Shalu district, Taiwan, from the National Health Insurance Research Database during 2000-2010. Multiple linear regression models were used to back extrapolate the historic concentration of individual components of PM2.5 from 2000 through to 2010, including black carbon (BC) and eight ions, namely, sulfate, nitrate (NO3-), ammonium, chloride, potassium (K+), magnesium, calcium, sodium. The odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of individual PM2.5 components on asthma was estimated by conditional logistic regression. A total of 887 asthma outpatient visits with individuals who have an average age of 7.96±3.88 years were selected. After adjusting for confounders, we found an interquartile range (IQR) increase in BC level, an IQR increase in NO3- level, and an IQR increase in K+ level that were all associated with the increased risk of asthma outpatient visits from the current day (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.34; OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21; and OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.30, respectively). The effects of these components on asthma were stronger in the cold season than in the warm season. However, we did not find any lagging effects. The results suggest that exposure to NO3-, BC, and K+ derived from industry-related combustion or motor vehicles emission sources may increase the risk of asthma outpatient visits, particularly during the cold season.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29787,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Rebound adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of ritonavir in a 65-year-old man using inhaled budesonide.","authors":"[Olivier, Veilleux][Todd C, Lee][Emily G, McDonald]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"18-Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28923796","articleAbstract":"-","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Review Required","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Validated Observation","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Non-Validated Observation","closed":true,"isClosed":false}]}

There is only scarce evidence regarding whether platelet inhibitors increase the risk of developing postoperative hemorrhage in carpal tunnel release.This is a multicenter, propensity score-matched study including 635 carpal tunnel releases in 497 patients. Multivariate regression models were adjusted with the propensity score, which was developed to mitigate differences in patients with and without platelet inhibition with acetylsalicylic acid. Propensity score matching provides results close to the statistical quality of randomized controlled trials. The primary study endpoint was postoperative bleeding complication, defined as acute bleeding leading to reoperation or hematoma leading to physician visit. Patient satisfaction, functional outcome measured with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, and onset of surgical-site infection were also analyzed.Bleeding complications were observed in 56 procedures (8.8 percent). After propensity score matching, there was no significant difference between the patients with and without acetylsalicylic acid treatment (p = 0.997). History of thyroid disease (p = 0.035) and of rheumatoid arthritis (p = 0.026) were independent risk factors, whereas higher body mass index might have a beneficial effect (p = 0.006). Patients with postoperative bleeding had significantly impaired functional outcome as measured with the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (p = 0.026). Median satisfaction in the investigated study population was 10 of 10 points and did not differ significantly between the antiplatelet and the non-antiplatelet cohorts (p = 0.072) CONCLUSION:: Carpal tunnel release under platelet inhibition with acetylsalicylic acid is safe and can be performed without interruption of such medication.Therapeutic, III.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55878,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Postoperative aspirin use and its effect on bone healing in the treatment of ankle fractures.","authors":"[Allison M, Hunter][Tyler P, Montgomery][Charles C, Pitts][Leonardo, Moraes][Matthew, Anderson][John, Wilson][Gerald, McGwin][Ashish, Shah]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31806383","articleAbstract":"There is hesitancy to administer nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) within the postoperative period following fracture care due to concern for delayed union or nonunion.

The current study examines the incidence of nonunion of operative ankle fractures and risk of DVT in patients who did and did not receive postoperative ASA.A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients treated between 2008 and 2018 for ankle fractures requiring operative fixation by three Foot and Ankle fellowship trained orthopaedic surgeons at a single institution. Demographics, preoperative comorbidities, and postoperative medical and surgical complications were compared between patients who did and did not receive ASA postoperatively. For both groups, union was evaluated by clinical exam as well as by radiograph, for those with 6-week, 12-week, or 24-week follow-up.Five-hundred and six patients met inclusion criteria: 152 who received ASA and 354 who did not.

High on-aspirin platelet reactivity (HAPR) is associated with increased risk for deleterious cardiovascular events. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between HAPR and albumin levels in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with aspirin. Patients with known stable CAD, who were taking aspirin (75 to 100 mg qd) regularly for at least 1 month, were screened for the present study. Exclusion criteria: cancer, sepsis or acute infection, active inflammatory/rheumatic disease, recent major surgery, chronic liver failure, the administration of other antiplatelet drugs, nonadherence with aspirin and thrombocytopenia. Blood was drawn from the participants and sent for SA level and platelet function test (VerifyNow). HAPR was defined as aspirin reaction units (ARU) >550. Overall 116 patients were analyzed; age 69 ± 10, 28% women. Twenty (17%) were hypoalbuminemic (≤3.5 g/dl). Hypoalbuminemic patients had similar characteristics to the normal albumin group except mildly higher creatinine in the former. SA levels were significantly lower in the hypoalbuminemic group (3.2 ± 0.2 g/dl vs 4.2 ± 0.4 g/dl, respectively, p <0.001) whereas mean ARU was significantly higher compared with the normal albumin group (548 ± 45 vs 444 ± 66 ARU, respectively, p <0.001). A significant inverse association was observed between SA and ARU with (R2 = 0.67, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders found that albumin ≤3.5 is the strongest predictor of HAPR in patients with stable CAD (hazards ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 32, p = 0.002). In conclusion, hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with HAPR in patients with stable CAD.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55888,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin Mono-Therapy for ischemic stroke.","authors":"[Ashish, Kumar][Mariam, Shariff][Rajkumar, Doshi]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"29-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31994939","articleAbstract":"-","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55866,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Role of aspirin-triggered lipoxin A4, aspirin, and salicylic acid in the modulation of the oxidative and inflammatory responses induced by plasma from women with pre-eclampsia.","authors":"[Aura María, Gil-Villa][Angela M, Alvarez][Manuela, Velásquez-Berrío][Mauricio, Rojas-López][Angela P, Cadavid J]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31696583","articleAbstract":"Oxidative stress and inflammation are key events leading to pre-eclampsia, involved in several maternal deaths. Low doses of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are used in the prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia. The synthesis of aspirin-triggered lipoxin (ATL) by cyclooxygenase-2 acetylation is an alternative mechanism of ASA, which could explain the effectiveness of ASA treatments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ASA, salicylates, and ATL in the modulation of the oxidative and inflammatory responses induced by plasma from women with pre-eclampsia.Plasma from 14 women with pre-eclampsia and 17 normotensive pregnant women was probed for inducing oxidative and inflammatory responses on endothelial cells and U937 promonocytes. The role of ATL, ASA, and salicylic acid (SA) on these events was evaluated.Plasma from women with pre-eclampsia induced TBARS and nitrotyrosine production on endothelial and U937 cells. Pre-treatment with both ATL and ASA decreased the TBARS production, while ATL decreased the nitrotyrosine. Pre-eclamptic plasma augmented the translocation of NF-kB on U937 cells, which decreased by a high dose of ASA and SA. Finally, the pre-eclamptic plasma increased the adhesion of leukocytes-PMN and monocytes-to endothelium, and we were able to determine a state of resolution of inflammation, since ATL decreased the PMN adhesion, and conversely, it increased the monocytes adhesion to endothelium.Together, these results suggest that ATL could explain the beneficial actions of ASA and support further research on mechanisms, real efficacy, and rational use of ASA in pre-eclampsia.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55918,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"N-acetylcysteine inhibits thrombosis in a murine model of myeloproliferative neoplasm.","authors":"[Brianna M, Craver][Gajalakshmi, Ramanathan][Summer, Hoang][Xinyue, Chang][Laura F, Mendez Luque][Stefan, Brooks][Hew Yeng, Lai][Angela G, Fleischman]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"28-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31978215","articleAbstract":"Thrombosis is a major cause of mortality in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), though there is currently little to offer patients with MPN beyond aspirin and cytoreductive therapies such as hydroxyurea for primary prevention. Thrombogenesis in MPN involves multiple cellular mechanisms, including platelet activation and neutrophil-extracellular trap formation; therefore, an antithrombotic agent that targets one or more of these processes would be of therapeutic benefit in MPN. Here, we treated the JAK2V617F knockin mouse model of polycythemia vera with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a sulfhydryl-containing compound with broad effects on glutathione replenishment, free radical scavenging, and reducing disulfide bonds, to investigate its antithrombotic effects in the context of MPN. Strikingly, NAC treatment extended the lifespan of JAK2V617F mice without impacting blood counts or splenomegaly. Using an acute pulmonary thrombosis model in vivo, we found that NAC reduced thrombus formation to a similar extent as the irreversible platelet inhibitor aspirin. In vitro analysis of platelet activation revealed that NAC reduced thrombin-induced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation in JAK2V617F mice. Furthermore, NAC reduced neutrophil extracellular trap formation in primary human neutrophils from patients with MPN as well as healthy controls. These results provide evidence that N-acetylcysteine inhibits thrombosis in JAK2V617F mice and provide a pre-clinical rationale for investigating NAC as a therapeutic to reduce thrombotic risk in MPN.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55886,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Ketorolac for Patients Undergoing Implant-Based Breast Reconstruction: Impact on Hospital Length of Stay and Postoperative Narcotic Use.","authors":"[Brittany N, Nguyen][Ruth J, Barta][Christine E, Stewart][Matthew, Wheelwright][Cherrie A, Heinrich]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"29-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31250006","articleAbstract":"Opioid drugs have been a mainstay medication for the management of postoperative pain for several decades; however, in recent years there has been a push towards investigating alternative treatment options.

The results showed that patients who received ketorolac had a decreased length of hospitalization: 1.9 days vs 2.1 days (P = 0.04), respectively.Generous narcotic prescribing has received greater scrutiny in recent years. Aside from the risk of increased narcotic availability in the community, the side effects of nausea, puritis, and constipation delay patient recovery.

Assessment of BBB permeability of MCS extract showed that compound 15 was able to cross the BBB making it a suitable candidate for developing CNS drugs.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55861,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Adjuvant antithrombotic therapy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Contemporaneous Portuguese cross-sectional data.","authors":"[Daniel, Caldeira][Hélder, Pereira][Ana, Marques][Sofia, Alegria][João, Calisto][Pedro Canas da, Silva][Vasco Gama, Ribeiro][João Carlos, Silva][Filipe, Seixo][Pedro Farto E, Abreu][Rui Campante, Teles][Renato, Fernandes][Henrique Cyrne, Carvalho][]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"29-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"32007322","articleAbstract":"The standard of care for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) includes the activation of a STEMI care network, the administration of adjuvant medical therapy, and reperfusion through primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). While primary PCI is nowadays the first option for the treatment of patients with STEMI, antithrombotic therapy, including antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents, is the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment to optimize their clinical outcomes.The aim of this study was to describe contemporaneous real-world patterns of use of antithrombotic treatments in Portugal for STEMI patients undergoing primary PCI.An observational, retrospective cross-sectional study was performed for the year 2016, based on data from two national registries: the Portuguese Registry on Acute Coronary Syndromes (ProACS) and the Portuguese Registry on Interventional Cardiology (PRIC). Data on oral antiplatelet and procedural intravenous antithrombotic drugs were retrieved.In 2016, the ProACS enrolled 534 STEMI patients treated with primary PCI, while the PRIC registry reported data on 2625 STEMI patients. Of these, 99.6% were treated with aspirin and 75.6% with dual antiplatelet therapy (mostly clopidogrel). GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (mostly abciximab) were used in 11.6% of cases. Heparins were used in 80% of cases (78% unfractionated heparin [UFH] and 2% low molecular weight heparin). None of the patients included in the registry were treated with cangrelor, prasugrel or bivalirudin. Missing data are one of the main limitations of the registries.In 2016, according to data from these national registries, almost all patients with STEMI were treated with aspirin and 76% with dual antiplatelet agents, mostly clopidogrel. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were used in few patients, and UFH was the most prevalent parenteral anticoagulant drug.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55909,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Gastrointestinal and uterine smooth muscles relaxant and anti-inflammatory effects of corchorus olitorius leaf extract in laboratory animal models.","authors":"[Daniel, Orieke][Obioma Christopher, Ohaeri][Ifeoma Irene, Ijeh][Solomon Nnah, Ijioma]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"30-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31509779","articleAbstract":"Corchorus olitorius is reportedly used in ethno-medicine to arrest threatened miscarriage and other conditions associated with excessive uterine contractions.

Anti-inflammatory study was carried out via the egg albumin-induced paw edema model in rats.The application of COLE to pieces of uterine tissue significantly decreased the amplitudes of contractions in a dose dependent manner such that the highest dose applied (666.67 μg/ml) achieved a 100% inhibitory effect. Oxytocin induced contractions were also significantly inhibited by both salbutamol and COLE. On the isolated rabbit jejunum, the effect of COLE was also inhibitory and like atropine, significantly inhibited acetylcholine induced contractions. In the in vivo study, the extract inhibited charcoal meal movement in test rats when compared with control. Anti-inflammatory effect of COLE was significant and compared favourably with that of aspirin following in vivo trials.COLE therefore, may be a good tocolytic, anti-diarrheal and anti-inflammatory agent and offers hope of new drug discovery for such uses.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55920,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Analysis of platelets by flow cytometry in patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH).","authors":"[David J, Araten][Daniel, Boxer][Leah, Zamechek][Erik, Sherman][Michael, Nardi]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31710879","articleAbstract":"The marked pro-thrombotic tendency in PNH is likely to be at least partly due to the population of platelets derived from the abnormal stem cell clone.

Cardiac surgery triggers inflammation in the heart and makes it susceptible to the incidence of AF. Therefore, anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the rate of AF incidence in the post-surgery conditions. Immunosuppressant agents, steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (corticosteroids), non-aspirin non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine and omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 UFA) are drugs with well-known anti-inflammatory properties. The efficacy, safety and other aspects of using these drugs in the prevention of post-operative AF (POAF) have been reviewed here. Studies evaluating the efficacy of colchicine have shown that it could be effective in the prevention of POAF. However, there is a need for additional studies to find a colchicine regimen with optimal efficacy and higher tolerability. The use of corticosteroids may also be of value based on the most of meta-analyses. In the case of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and NSAIDs, current data fail to support their efficacy in POAF prevention. Moreover, perioperative administration of NSAIDs may be associated with some severe safety considerations. Immunosuppressant agents have not been used for the prevention of POAF.

Despite recent advances in the treatment for CRC, resistance to chemotherapy drugs and recurrence of the tumor are among the main problems for treatment in this cancer. The MTT assay was performed to assess the cytotoxic effects of drugs on CRC cell lines (SW742 and SW480) and normal colon cells. Three-dimensional culture (spheroid) was also used to evaluate the effect of drugs on tumor cell masses. The rate of expression of genes was also evaluated using Real-Time PCR. The analysis of the results demonstrated that aspirin and LGK974 have cytotoxic effects on CRC cell lines, and in the IC50 dose, they disintegrate the cancerous cell masses. These drugs reduce the invasion and increase apoptosis in SW742 and SW480 cell lines. A decrease in the expression of WNT, AXIN, TCF and APC genes and an increase in the expression of β-catenin gene in the WNT signaling pathway were revealed. The genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway such as ERK, JNK, KRAS and MEK showed a decrease in expression and a increase in expression of RAF gene. In the apoptotic pathway, increased expression of BAX and decreased expression of BCL-2 were reported. Also, decreased expression of P53, cyclin D1 and COX-2 was observed. This study demonstrates that aspirin and LGK974 could be effective in inhibiting the signaling pathways of WNT and MAPK, arresting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in CRC cell lines.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55889,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Preeclampsia in women with pregestational diabetes - a cohort study.","authors":"[Maria Lúcia Da Rocha, Oppermann][Janine, Alessi][Vânia Naomi, Hirakata][Daniela Mascarenhas, Wiegand][Angela Jacob, Reichelt]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31875734","articleAbstract":"Aims: To evaluate risk factors for preeclampsia (PE) in women with pregestational diabetes.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of women with pregestational diabetes cared for at a specialized prenatal care facility.

Two non-modifiable factors (type of diabetes and chronic hypertension) and two modifiable ones (systolic blood pressure levels and gestational weight gain) were found relevant in this cohort. A policy of close monitoring of blood pressure and weight gain, aiming adequate weight gain, may be added to current recommended measures. The high prevalence of PE in women with prepregnancy diabetes, especially those with initial pregnancy systolic blood pressure >124 mmHg, supports a policy of early institution of low dose aspirin. Further multicentric studies will help define the role of these risk factors as contributors to PE in pregestational diabetes.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55885,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"The time course of nasal cytokine secretion in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) undergoing aspirin desensitization: preliminary data.","authors":"[Marion, San Nicoló][Catalina, Högerle][Donata, Gellrich][Katharina, Eder][Elisabeth, Pfrogner][Moritz, Gröger]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31655881","articleAbstract":"Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) is a severe form of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) accompanied by asthma and an aspirin intolerance.

However, it is unknown which agents should be used to prevent recurrent VTE and which patients with unprovoked VTE should receive extended anticoagulation. We therefore sought to compare the efficacy and safety among DOACs for secondary prevention of VTE. We also determined a risk-adapted threshold for initiating extended anticoagulation based on the likelihood of VTE recurrence (without treatment) and bleeding (with treatment) in patients with unprovoked VTE.Our systematic review of randomized controlled trials compares extended anticoagulation with DOACs to another DOAC, aspirin, or placebo for the prevention of recurrent VTE. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Registry of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in October 2018. Our outcomes of interest were VTE recurrence, major bleeding, and all clinically relevant bleeding. We used network meta-analysis to make indirect comparisons among DOACs. We populated the threshold decision-analytic model with data from our meta-analysis to determine the risk of VTE recurrence above which the benefits of extended anticoagulation outweigh the harms compared with no treatment.We included four, high-quality, randomized trials comprising 8386 participants. Low-dose apixaban, full-dose apixaban, low-dose rivaroxaban, full-dose rivaroxaban, and dabigatran reduce VTE recurrence compared with placebo (RR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.12-0.31; RR = 0.20, 95% CI, 0.12-0.32; RR = 0.08, 95% CI, 0.03-0.27; RR = 0.14, 95% CI, 0.06-0.35; RR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.09-0.40, respectively). No DOACs increased major bleeding risk compared with placebo. A VTE recurrence risk above 0.3% to 0.4% at approximately 1 year is the threshold to treat a patient with unprovoked VTE with extended anticoagulation (with any DOAC).All DOACs exhibit comparable efficacy for the prevention of recurrent VTE. Given that the risk of VTE recurrence is much higher than the calculated threshold for treatment, extended thromboprophylaxis should be considered in all patients with unprovoked VTE who do not have increased bleeding risk.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55908,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"The dawn of aspirin free strategy after short term dual antiplatelet for percutaneous coronary intervention: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","authors":"[Mohammed, Osman][Peter D, Farjo][Khansa, Osman][Qais, Radaideh][Muhammad Bilal, Munir][Babikir, Kheiri][Sudarshan, Balla]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31749123","articleAbstract":"There is still a debate about the safety and efficacy of an aspirin free strategy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Data indicate that long-term intake of low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of CRC; however, the mechanisms underlying this chemopreventive effect are still unclear. Different mouse models for inflammation-associated, sporadic, and hereditary CRC were applied to assess the efficacy and mechanism of low-dose aspirin on tumor prevention. An initial dosing study performed in healthy mice indicates that aspirin at a dose of 25 mg/kg/d has a similar pharmacodynamic effect as low-dose aspirin treatment in human subjects (100 mg/d). Chronic low-dose aspirin treatment suppresses colitis-associated and to a lesser extent spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice. Aspirin's antitumor effect is most pronounced in a preventive approach when aspirin administration starts before the tumor-initiating genotoxic event and continues for the duration of the experiment. These effects are not associated with alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis, or activation of signaling pathways involved in CRC. Aspirin-induced reduction in tumor burden is accompanied by inhibition of thromboxane B2 formation, indicating reduced platelet activation. Aspirin treatment also results in decreased colonic prostaglandin E2 formation and tumor angiogenesis. With respect to colitis-triggered tumorigenesis, aspirin administration is associated with a reduction in inflammatory activity in the colon, as indicated by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, and tumor-associated iNOS-positive macrophages. Our results suggest that low-dose aspirin represents an effective antitumor agent in the context of colon tumorigenesis primarily due to its well-established cyclooxygenase inhibition effects.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55876,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Tackling Elevated Risk in PAD: Focus on Antithrombotic and Lipid Therapy for PAD.","authors":"[Nicholas, Govsyeyev][Mark R, Nehler][William R, Hiatt][Marc P, Bonaca]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"29-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31997026","articleAbstract":"The PAD population is at increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE).

Within its resolution limits, benchtop NMR spectroscopy is useful in determining the identity of the active ingredients in products containing acetaminophen, aspirin, caffeine, diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, sildenafil, tadalafil and sibutramine, cocaine, and gamma hydroxybutyric acid, with a limit of detection of about 1 mg/mL. Furthermore, the content of the active ingredient can be determined with an error of 10%. Additionally, a chemometrics approach is shown to be useful to classify spectra in order to identify the active substances present in the sample, reducing the need for expert interpretation of the spectra acquired.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55883,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Aspirin Therapy for Primary Prevention: The Case for Continuing Prescribing to Patients at High Cardiovascular Risk-A Review.","authors":"[Raffaele, De Caterina][Alberto, Aimo][Paul M, Ridker]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31887781","articleAbstract":"Current evidence supports the use of low-dose aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. By contrast, the benefit-to-risk ratio of aspirin use in primary prevention is debated: three contemporary randomized control trials have been conflicting, and meta-analyses have concluded for an unclear clinical benefit, based on the consideration that the reduction in thromboembolic events is counterbalanced by increased bleeding. The primary prevention setting is, however, a heterogeneous mix of subjects at highly variable cardiovascular risk. One possible explanation for the uncertainty of data interpretation is the progressive reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in primary prevention that has accompanied global education programs, leading patients to smoke less, exercise more, and increasingly take lipid-lowering therapies. Based on a meta-regression of the benefits and harm of aspirin therapy in primary prevention as a function of the 10-year risk of MACE, we favor a nuanced approach still, however, based on the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, acknowledging differences between patients and emphasizing an individualized assessment of both benefits and harm. After optimal control of cardiovascular risk factors, and when patients are less than 70 years of age, clinicians should assess the risk of MACE and base decision on such stratification, considering the risk of bleeding and patient preferences. Clinicians would then advise the use of aspirin in primary prevention patients at the highest risk of MACE who do not have a prohibitive risk of bleeding, and in the majority of cases after initiation of properly titrated statin therapy.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55904,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Direct Repair of Iatrogenic Vertebral Artery Injury Associated With Anterior Cervical Corpectomy: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.","authors":"[Rami O, Almefty][Felipe C, Albuquerque][Robert F, Spetzler][Jay D, Turner]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31214707","articleAbstract":"Vertebral artery (VA) injury during anterior cervical spine surgery has potentially devastating neurovascular consequences. Our video highlights the operative nuances of exposing and directly repairing the V2 segment of the VA from an anterior approach. A 67-year-old woman undergoing anterior cervical corpectomy at another hospital began briskly bleeding from a suspected VA injury. Upon emergency transfer of the patient to our facility, angiography confirmed a right VA pseudoaneurysm at the level of the C5 corpectomy. The decision was made to repair the VA directly, thus avoiding vessel sacrifice and stenting. The previous anterior exposure was reopened. The longus colli was mobilized laterally on the right side to expose the C4 and C6 anterior tubercles. A plane was developed in the transverse foramina from C4 to C6, and the foramina were unroofed anteriorly using a high-speed drill and Kerrison rongeurs. The injured segment of the VA was exposed, and the platelet plug over the injured VA was identified. The proximal and distal ends of the injured segment were temporarily clipped, and the platelet plug was removed, revealing a small, ovoid-shaped' full-thickness arterial wall defect. The VA injury was repaired with simple running 10-0 nylon sutures. Indocyanine green angiography confirmed rapid filling of the patent lumen. The corpectomy and anterior fixation were completed. The patient was placed on aspirin therapy postoperatively. The patient remained neurologically intact without neurovascular sequelae at the 1-yr follow-up.

CRC is the second most common cancer-related death in both men and women globally. Chronic inflammation has been identified as one of the major risk factors of CRC. It may drive genetic and epigenetic/epigenomic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation. Current prevention modalities for CRC are limited and some treatment regimens such as use the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug aspirin may have severe side effects, namely gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding. Therefore, there is an urgent need of developing alternative strategies. Recently, increasing evidence suggests that several dietary cancer chemopreventive phytochemicals possess anti-inflammation and antioxidative stress activities, and may prevent cancers including CRC. Curcumin (CUR) is the yellow pigment that is found in the rhizomes of turmeric (Curcuma longa). Many studies have demonstrated that CUR exhibit strong anticancer, antioxidative stress, and anti-inflammatory activities by regulating signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2, nuclear factor-κB, and epigenetics/epigenomics pathways of histones modifications, and DNA methylation. In this review, we will discuss the latest evidence in epigenetics/epigenomics alterations by CUR in CRC and their potential contribution in the prevention of CRC.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55917,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Ischemic Stroke and Bleeding: Clinical Benefit of Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation After Intracerebral Hemorrhage.","authors":"[Robert J, Stanton][Mark H, Eckman][Daniel, Woo][Charles J, Moomaw][Mary, Haverbusch][Matthew L, Flaherty][Dawn O, Kleindorfer]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"31-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"32000590","articleAbstract":"Background and Purpose- Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at risk for ischemic events. While risk calculators (CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED) have been validated to assess risk for ischemic stroke and major bleeding in AF patients, decisions about anticoagulation must consider the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation. Furthermore, stroke and bleeding risk are highly correlated, making decisions more difficult. Methods- We examined patients in the GERFHS III study (Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Stroke)-a population-based retrospective study of spontaneous ICH patients without a structural or traumatic cause in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region between July 2008 and December 2012. CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-B(L)ED (minus L because labile international normalized ratio was unavailable) scores were calculated for ICH patients with AF. Using a Markov state transition model, we estimated net clinical benefit of anticoagulation relative to no treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We defined minimal clinically relevant benefit as 0.1 QALYs. Results- Among 1186 cases of spontaneous ICH, 95 cases had AF and met our survival criteria. Within 1 year, 8 of 95 (8%) would be expected to have a major bleeding event on anticoagulation, and 5 of 95 (5%) of patients would be expected to have an ischemic stroke off anticoagulation. Sixty-eight of 95 (71%) patients would have higher risk for major bleeding than for ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation with directly acting anticoagulants would result in no clinically significant gain or loss in 73%. Roughly 12% would gain >0.1 QALYs, and 15% would lose >0.1 QALYs. Among patients receiving aspirin, most have no significant net clinical benefit or loss. Overall, anticoagulation of the entire cohort would result in an aggregate loss of 0.92 QALYs. Conclusions- Our analysis suggests that universal anticoagulation after ICH would be associated with a net loss of QALY. Additional factors should be considered before anticoagulating patients with AF after ICH. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

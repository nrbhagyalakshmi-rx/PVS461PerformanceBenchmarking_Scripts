In particular, Immunomax was shown to polarize mouse bone marrow macrophages from the M0 and M2 states into the M1 state (ARG1 and iNOS mRNA expression levels were used to identify the mouse M1 and M2 phenotypes). Next, we investigated the prophylactic antiviral effect of Immunomax in both a model of mouse respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and a model of RSV-induced bronchial asthma (BA) exacerbation. In the experiment with RSV-induced BA exacerbation, Immunomax-treated mice were characterized by a significant decrease of the viral load in lung homogenates, an increased amount of M1 macrophages in the lung, a tendency toward Th2-dependent ovalbumin-specific IgG1 antibodies decrease in blood serum, a significant increase in RSV-activated CD4+ T cells secreting IFNγ (Th1 cells), and a simultaneous significant decrease in the amount of CD4+ cells secreting IL-4 (Th2 cells) in the mouse spleen, which were detected by ELISPOT 1.5 months after experiment. These findings suggest that treatment with the TLR4 agonist Immunomax polarizes the immune response towards antiviral Th1 and may be used for short-term antiviral prophylaxis to prevent acute respiratory viral infections in asthmatics.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":22364,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"SUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY FOR ALLERGIC ASTHMA AND RHINITIS.","authors":"[A A, Telia][A Z, Telia][K, Machavariani][Z, Telia]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Mar-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"29697395","articleAbstract":"The purpose of our study was to perform a meta-analysis and thus, based on original randomized placebo-controlled studies, evaluate the effectiveness and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) in children and adults suffering from allergic bronchial asthma and rhinitis.

Of these, 30 concerned the efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy of allergic rhinitis, and 8 of bronchial asthma. In active groups, 347 patients with asthma and 1888 rhinitis were involved, and in the control groups, respectively, 332 and 1795 subjects studied. There were 7 different meta-analytical comparisons based on the purpose of our study. Our Meta-analytic study on the selected publications have been shown that sublingual immunotherapy in children and adults suffering from allergic bronchial asthma and rhinitis is effective and safe. However, based on the low evidentiary level and high heterogeneity of the publication that we used in the meta-analysis, unambiguous recommendations regarding the advisability of using the sublingual immunotherapy method in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma are premature. For all these reasons, the results of this analysis should be interpreted by the various selected population subgroups, following specific recommendations addressed to unified results, endpoints, time points, measurement scales and dosages, treatment distribution and power calculation. Despite our results, we believe that there are arguments indicating that SLIT may be a promising direction in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma, but it should not be prescribed regularly to all patients.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28859,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Naltrexone: A History and Future Directions.","authors":"[A Benjamin, Srivastava][Mark S, Gold]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"-","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"30746025","articleAbstract":"Trying to kick drug addiction without medicines is said to be like relying on willpower to overcome diabetes or asthma.

According to this concept, upper and lower airway diseases are frequently comorbid because they reflect manifestations of a single underlying disease at different sites of the respiratory tract. Allergic asthma-allergic rhinitis is the archetypal UAD, but emerging data indicate that UAD is a heterogeneous condition and consists of multiple phenotypes (observable clinical characteristics) and endotypes (pathobiologic mechanisms). The UAD paradigm also extends to myriad sinonasal diseases (eg, chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps) and lower airway diseases (eg, bronchiectasis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Here, we review currently known phenoendotypes of UAD and propose a \"treatable traits\" approach for the classification and management of UAD, wherein pathophysiological mechanisms and factors contributing to disease are identified and targeted for treatment. Treatable traits in UAD can be analyzed according to a framework comprising airway inflammation (eosinophilic, neutrophilic), impaired airway mucosal defense (impaired mucociliary clearance, antibody deficiency), and exogenous cofactors (allergic sensitizers, tobacco smoke, microbes). Appreciation of treatable traits is necessary in advancing the effort to deliver precise treatments and achieve better outcomes in patients with UAD.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28797,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Enhanced expression of PD-L1 and IFN-γ on dendritic cells is associated with BCG-induced T

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the neonatal BCG vaccination in the innate immune response in a mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation. BCG treated neonatal BALB/c mice were sensitized and challenged with aerosolized OVA. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, samples were collected for analysis. The intranasal BCG treatment inhibited the allergic Th2-response by decreasing the allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation, EPO activity, CCL11, IL-25, TSLP, IL-4 and IL-5 lung levels, and serum levels of IgE. Mycobacteria treatment increased lung levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, and the TLR2 and TLR4 expressions by pulmonary CD11c+CD103+CD8α+ DCs. Additionally an enhanced expression of PD-L1 was observed besides an increased production of IFN-γ by these cells. These results indicated that neonatal BCG vaccination inhibits key features of allergic airway inflammation, probably by promoting T regulatory immune response via an enhanced expression of TLR2, TLR4 and PD-L1 on DCs.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":25342,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"The prevalence of allergic diseases among children with asthma: What is the impact on asthma control in South East Nigeria?","authors":"[A C, Ayuk][J N, Eze][B O, Edelu][T, Oguonu]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"May-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"29735865","articleAbstract":"Allergic diseases are known to occur in children with asthma and its coexistence with asthma may impact on asthma control in affected children living in a low-income country.

Some of these factors are plausibly still unknown.
2000
 Quantitative risk assessment shows that limiting exposure through control of dose reduces the rates of reactions in allergic populations, but its impact on the relative frequency of severe reactions at different doses is unclear. Food challenge studies suggest that the relationship between dose of allergenic food and reaction severity is complex even under relatively controlled conditions. Because of these complexities, epidemiological studies provide very limited insight into this aspect of the dose-response relationship. Emerging data from single-dose challenges suggest that graded food challenges may overestimate the rate of severe reactions. It may be necessary to generate new data (such as those from single-dose challenges) to reliably identify the effect of dose on severity for use in QRA. Success will reduce uncertainty in the susceptible population and improve consumer choice.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":22814,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Prenatal antimicrobial use and early-childhood body mass index.","authors":"[A E, Cassidy-Bushrow][C, Burmeister][S, Havstad][A M, Levin][S V, Lynch][D R, Ownby][A G, Rundle][K J, Woodcroft][E M, Zoratti][C C, Johnson][G, Wegienka]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Jan-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28925412","articleAbstract":"Growing evidence suggests that antibiotic use is associated with childhood body mass index (BMI), potentially via mechanisms mediated by gut microbiome alterations.

In contrast, there was some suggestion for an effect on immune responsiveness, as moisture damage with visible mold was positively associated with LPS-stimulated production of TNF-α and minor moisture damage was inversely associated with PI-stimulated IL-1β. While early life exposure to mold damage may have some influence on later immune responsiveness, it does not seem to increase subclinical systemic inflammation in later life.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":23496,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medi

Due to the divergent roles of IL-33 in regulating mast cell functions, there is a need to further characterize IL-33/ST2-dependent mast cell responses and their significance in the context of asthma. This study aimed to investigate how IL-33/ST2-dependent mast cell responses contribute to the development of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and airway inflammation in a mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma. Mast cell-deficient C57BL/6-KitW-sh (Wsh) mice engrafted with either wild-type (Wsh + MC-WT) or ST2-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells (Wsh + MC-ST2KO) were exposed to HDM delivered intranasally. An exacerbated development of AHR in response to HDM was seen in Wsh + MC-ST2KO compared with Wsh + MC-WT mice. The contribution of this IL-33/ST2-dependent mast cell response to AHR seems to reside within the smaller airways in the peripheral parts of the lung, as suggested by the isolated yet marked effect on tissue resistance. Considering the absence of a parallel increase in cellular inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung, the aggravated AHR in Wsh + MC-ST2KO mice seems to be independent of cellular inflammation. We observed an association between the elevated AHR and reduced PGE2 levels in BALF. Due to the protective properties of PGE2 in airway responses, it is conceivable that IL-33/ST2-dependent mast cell induction of PGE2 could be responsible for the dampening effect on AHR. In conclusion, we reveal that IL-33/ST2-dependent mast cell responses can have a protective, rather than causative role, in the development of AHR.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":22894,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Gender features of comorbidity in patients with coronary artery disease.","authors":"[A N, Sumin][E V, Korok][A V, Shcheglova][O L, Barbarash]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"19-Apr-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"30701873","articleAbstract":"To study the factors associated with high levels of comorbidity in men and women with coronary artery disease (CAD).The data analyzed 742 patients who were screened in the clinic of the research Institute CPSS in 2011, before planned operation coronary artery bypass grafting.

Primary efficacy was assessed via week-12 change from baseline in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ). Secondary efficacy assessments included patient-reported outcome (PRO) asthma assessments (Asthma Daily Diary data [AM and PM peak expiratory flow rate, number of puffs of albuterol/salbutamol, the presence of nocturnal awakenings and asthma symptom score]).The study did not meet the primary end-point. However, nominally significant improvements in pre-bronchodilator FEV1 were observed with JNJ-39758979 versus placebo at week 12 in pre-specified subgroups with elevated exhaled nitric oxide, sputum eosinophils or blood eosinophils at baseline. Nominally significant improvements across PRO assessments were consistently observed in the overall population, as well as in eosinophilic subgroups.

the disease and plausible associations.Herein, we discuss the case of a 54-year old white male, who presented with features of ANCA vasculitis with haemoptysis, arthralgia, abnormal kidney function with active urine sediment and a positive p-ANCA titre. Standard immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and intravenous rituximab resulted in disease remission. Due to significant steroid side effects, his steroid treatment was gradually tapered and switched to azathioprine over a 6-month period. Two weeks following initiation of azathioprine, he developed a painful maculo-papular erythematous skin rash and fever. A skin biopsy confirmed classical features consistent with Sweet syndrome. Withdrawal of azathioprine and treatment with oral corticosteroids and colchicine therapy resulted in complete resolution of the rash, although he continued to have high titres of MPO positive ANCA.Sweet syndrome is a rare adverse reaction to azathioprine but has also been reported to occur in association with ANCA vasculitis. The temporal association with azathioprine in our case and the relatively rapid resolution of the skin vasculitis upon its withdrawal suggested a primarily drug-induced reaction rather than an associated feature of ANCA vasculitis.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":27585,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Treatment for food allergy.","authors":"[A Wesley, Burks][Hugh A, Sampson][Marshall, Plaut][Gideon, Lack][Cezmi A, Akdis]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Jan-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"29307409","articleAbstract":"The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy is an increasing public health concern effecting millions of persons worldwide.

Information about medical history was obtained during a standardized interview with the mothers. Candidate polymorphisms in genes of the Th2 cytokines IL4, IL10, IL13 and IL4-receptor, were genotyped or imputed.None of the variant alleles were directly associated with childhood acute lymphoid leukaemia. A medical history of asthma or eczema was reported more often in the control group (OR = 0.7 [0.5-1.0]).

However, the literature has not been reviewed systematically and the meta-analytic reviews include old studies. This study aimed to examine whether the prevalence of worsening asthma during pregnancy is still consistent with prior estimate or it has been reduced.A detailed Clinical Questionnaire on respiratory symptoms, medical history, medication, use of services, occupation, social status, home environment and lifestyle was administered to random samples of the Italian population in the frame of the Gene Environment Interactions in Respiratory Diseases (GEIRD) study. Only clinical data belong to 2.606 subjects that completed the clinical stage of the GEIRD study, were used for the present study.Out of 1.351 women, 284 self-reported asthma and 92 of them had at least one pregnancy. When we considered the asthma course during pregnancy, we found that 16 women worsened, 31 remained unchanged, 25 improved. Seven women had not the same course in the different pregnancies and 13 did not know. The starting age of ICS use almost overlaps with that of asthma onset in women with worsening asthma during pregnancy (19 years ± 1.4), unlike the other women who started to use ICS much later (30.3 years ± 12). In addition, the worsening of asthma was more frequent in women with an older age of onset of asthma (18 years ± 9 vs 13 years ± 10). Among women who completed the ACT during the clinical interview, the 50% of women who experienced worsening asthma during pregnancy (6/12) had an ACT score below 20.Asthma was observed to worsen during pregnancy in a percentage much lower to that generally reported in all the previous studies. There is still room in clinical practice to further reduce worsening of asthma during pregnancy by improving asthma control, with a more structured approach to asthma education and management prepregnancy.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":24721,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Prenatal exposure to perfluoralkyl substances (PFASs) associated with respiratory tract infections but not allergy- and asthma-related health outcomes in childhood.","authors":"[A, Impinen][U C, Nygaard][K C, Lødrup Carlsen][P, Mowinckel][K H, Carlse

The six most abundant PFASs were perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Health outcomes were assessed at two and ten years of age, and included reported obstructive airways disease (wheeze by 10 years; asthma by 2 and 10 years; reduced lung function at birth; allergic rhinitis by 10 years), atopic dermatitis (AD) by 2 and 10 years, allergic sensitization by 10 years, and episodes of common respiratory tract infections (common cold by 2 years, lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) by 10 years). The associations between exposure and health outcomes were examined using logistic and Poisson regression.The number of reported airways infections were significantly associated with cord blood concentrations of PFAS; common colds by two years with PFUnDA (β = 0.11 (0.08-0.14)) and LRTIs from 0 to 10 years of age with PFOS (β = 0.50 (0.42-0.57)), PFOA (β = 0.28 (0.22-0.35)), PFOSA (β = 0.10 (0.06-0.14)), PFNA (β = 0.09 (0.03-0.14)) and PFUnDA (β = 0.18 (0.13-0.23)) concentrations. Neither reduced lung function at birth, asthma, allergic rhinitis, AD nor allergic sensitization were significantly associated with any of the PFASs.Although prenatal exposure to PFASs was not associated with atopic or lung manifestations by 10 years of age, several PFASs were associated with an increased number of respiratory tract infections in the first 10 years of life, suggesting immunosuppressive effects of PFASs.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":22838,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Allergy rhinitis: similarities and differences between children and adults.","authors":"[A, Izquierdo-Dominguez][I, Jauregui][A, Del Cuvillo][J, Montoro][I, Davila][J, Sastre][J, Bartra][M, Ferrer][I, Alobid][J, Mullol][A L, Valero]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Dec-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28887880","articleAbstract":"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. Although a number of studies have described AR, no studies compared children and adult AR populations. The objective was to compare the AR characteristics between two AR cohorts of children and adults.Two AR cohorts (children and adults) from Spain were studied through observational cross-sectional multicentre studies. AR was classified based on classical (allergen exposure), original (o-ARIA), and modified (m-ARIA) ARIA criteria. AR was evaluated by Total 4-Symptoms Score (T4SS), and disease severity by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-100 mm). AR comorbidities were also evaluated.A total of 5,405 patients (1,275 children, 4,130 adults) were studied. According to symptoms duration, intermittent AR was more frequent in children than in adults. Using o-ARIA severity, more children than adults had moderate/severe AR while, using m-ARIA, more children than adults had severe AR. T4SS was higher in adults than in children. Moreover, VAS was also higher in adults than in children. In addition, asthma atopic dermatitis and conjunctivitis were more associated to children than adults with AR, the frequency of this comorbidities increasing according to higher severity.AR in children was more intermittent, severe, with less symptoms but with more comorbidities than in adults. These results suggest AR has similarities but also significant differences between children and adults.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":24778,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"[Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome)].","authors":"[A, Jerrentrup][T, Müller][J, Mariss][S, Dylla]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"May-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28983650","articleAbstract":"This article presents the case of a patient with dyspnea, a history of poorly controlled asthma, sinonasal polyposis, blood eosinophilia and transient pulmonary infiltrates.

The delay between onset and diagnosis in this case was several years. Although EGPA belongs to the spectrum of ANCA-associated vasculitis, less than 50% of EGPA patients are ANCA positive. Cardiac involvement (such as endomyocardial infiltration, arrhythmia and pericarditis) is the major cause of early death and a poor prognosis.

Risk factors for asthma and Toxocara spp. infection were assessed by a questionnaire given to each patient. Blood samples were analysed to measure levels of anti-Toxocara spp. immunoglobulin G (IgG). Patients with bronchial asthma were observed to have higher Toxocara spp. seropositivity than that of the non-asthmatic controls (6 vs 2%, P = 0.47). The mean anti-Toxocara spp. antibody titre was not significantly higher in patients with bronchial asthma than in individuals without asthma (P = 0.395, 95% CI = 0.579-1.45). There was no significant difference in the mean age, sex, social class, exposure to smoking and presence of domestic dog or cat at home between the two groups (P ≥ 0.05). The presence of anti-Toxocara spp. IgG was statistically associated with higher blood eosinophils, but it was not associated with asthma (P ≥ 0.05). The observed relationship between exposure to Toxocara spp. infection and bronchial asthma in Iranian patients warrants further evaluation. An understanding of any potential influence on the pathogenesis of human asthma provides a potential avenue for prevention.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Review Required","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Validated Observation","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Non-Validated Observation","closed":true,"isClosed":false}]}

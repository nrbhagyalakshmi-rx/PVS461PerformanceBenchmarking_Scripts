The present study investigated the incidence and determined the prognostic significance of hypoalbuminaemia in patients with confirmed acute PE.From a dedicated tertiary-referral centre database involving 1,426 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed PE (2000-2012), 1,032 patients had serum albumin assessed on admission (day-1). Patients were stratified into hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g/L) or normal serum albumin (≥35 g/L). Multivariable logistic and Cox proportional-hazards regression methods were used to assess 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality.Hypoalbuminaemia was present in 160 (15.5%) patients at day-1 and was associated with higher mean (±SD) heart rate (94.4 ± 21.8 vs 87.8 ± 21.5 bpm), lower systolic blood pressure (131.0 ± 24.7 vs 142.3 ± 24.7 mmHg), lower arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation (93.3 ± 6.1% vs 95.6 ± 4.0%), lower day-1 serum sodium (137.0 ± 4.7 vs 138.8 ± 3.8 mmol/L) and haemoglobin levels (114.4 ± 20.7 vs 131.5 ± 18.7 g/L). Patients with hypoalbuminaemia had higher incidence of malignancy (44.4% vs 18.8%) and chronic renal disease (9.4% vs 5.2%), and at admission were less likely to be taking aspirin/clopidogrel (19.3% vs 27.7%) and more likely to be using enoxaparin (6.7% vs 3.0%). During a mean follow-up of 5.0 ± 4.0 years, patients with hypoalbuminaemia had higher 30-day (16.3% vs 3.6%) and 90-day (26.3% vs 6.2%) mortality. Multivariable analyses showed hypoalbuminaemia independently predicted both 30-day (odds ratio 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-6.41) and 90-day (hazard ratio 2.42 95% CI 1.38-4.22) mortality.Hypoalbuminaemia is an independent predictor of mortality following PE and may improve risk stratification of patients in risk prediction models.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false}]}

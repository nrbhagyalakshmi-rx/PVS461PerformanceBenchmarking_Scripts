We hypothesized that regular exercise improves asthma control among young adults.We studied 162 subjects with current asthma recruited from a population-based cohort study of 1,623 young adults 20-27 years of age. Asthma control was assessed by the occurrence of asthma-related symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and phlegm production, during the past 12 months. Asthma symptom score was calculated based on reported frequencies of these symptoms (range: 0-12). Exercise was assessed as hours/week.In Poisson regression, adjusting for gender, age, smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and education, the asthma symptom score reduced by 0.09 points per 1 hour of exercise/week (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.17). Applying the \"Low exercise\" quartile as the reference, \"Medium exercise\" reduced the asthma symptom score by 0.66 (-0.39 to 1.72), and \"High exercise\" reduced it significantly by 1.13 (0.03 to 2.22). The effect was strongest among overweight subjects.Our results provide new evidence that regular exercising among young adults improves their asthma control. Thus, advising about exercise should be included as an important part of asthma self-management in clinical practice.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29835,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Lower Airway Inflammation in Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis as Determined by Exhaled Nitric Oxide.","authors":"[Rumi, Kambara][Takafumi, Minami][Hitoshi, Akazawa][Fumio, Tsuji][Takanobu, Sasaki][Hidenori, Inohara][Arata, Horii]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28848094","articleAbstract":"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is classified into eosinophilic CRS (ECRS) and non-ECRS. The objectives of this study were to evaluate lower airway inflammation by measuring the fractional concentration of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and to examine the effects of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on FeNO in patients with ECRS compared to non-ECRS.CRS patients with nasal polyps (23 with ECRS and 22 with non-ECRS) were enrolled into this study. ECRS was diagnosed based on the definition proposed by the Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis (JESREC) study group. Several clinical markers including blood eosinophil counts, percent of eosinophils in white blood cells (WBC), number of eosinophils in nasal polyps, JESREC scores, total IgE, FeNO, and Lund-Mackay paranasal sinus CT scores were compared between ECRS and non-ECRS. These markers were also tested before and 2 months after ESS.FeNO was significantly higher in patients with ECRS than in non-ECRS patients. When all CRS patients were tested, a significant correlation was found between FeNO and eosinophilic markers including blood eosinophil counts, percent of eosinophils in WBC, number of eosinophils in nasal polyps, and JESREC scores. FeNO showed a significant correlation with Lund-Mackay scores only in ECRS patients. Blood eosinophil counts, percent of eosinophils in WBC, and FeNO decreased after ESS only in ECRS patients.ECRS patients had lower airway inflammation as revealed by an elevated FeNO, which was parallel to the Lund-Mackay CT scores. ESS decreased the blood eosinophils and FeNO, leading to an improvement of the occult pulmonary dysfunction in ECRS patients.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29834,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Psychometric Properties of the COPD-Specific Beliefs About Medicine Questionnaire in an Outpatient Population: A Rasch-Analysis.","authors":"[Marie, Topp][Jørgen, Vestbo][Erik Lykke, Mortensen]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"02-Sep-2016","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28848900","articleAbstract":"Background: Understanding non-adherence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains challenging. The necessity and the concerns scales of the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) are known to correlate with adherence behavior in several chronic diseases including asthma but less is known about COPD. In the present study a COPD-specific BMQ (BMQ-COPD) was translated and administered to Danish COPD outpatients. Our aim was to derive high-quality measures of the 2 dimensions included in the BMQ-COPD. Methods: A total of 168 patients with COPD were included from a Danish respiratory outpatient clinic. The Rasch model was used to evaluate psychometric characteristics of the BMQ-COPD and to obtain necessity and concerns scales fulfilling criteria of unidimensionality and overall fit, and with all items showing individual item fit with no local dependencies, and no differential item functioning. Further, we explored the association with disease-related variables and subsequent adherence behavior. Results: Shortened versions of the original necessity and concerns scales fitted the Rasch model and were at least as good as the original scales as predictors of adherence, although only the necessity scale was significantly associated with adherence. Conclusion: In a Danish COPD setting high-quality measures of necessity and concerns could be derived from the BMQ-COPD. The excluded items appear to reflect other dimensions.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29833,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Adaptation of an asthma management program to a small clinic.","authors":"[Kenny Yat-Choi, Kwong][Nasser, Redjal][Lyne, Scott][Marilyn, Li][Salima, Thobani][Brian, Yang]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Jul-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28850792","articleAbstract":"Asthma management programs, such as the Breathmobile program, have been extremely effective in reducing asthma morbidity and increasing disease control; however, their high start-up costs may preclude their implementation in smaller health systems.

We hypothesize that BEC-derived factors promote in situ eosinophil differentiation and maturation, a process that is driven by an IL-5-rich microenvironment in asthmatic airways. To assess the eosinophilopoietic potential of epithelial-derived factors, eosinophil/basophil colony forming units (Eo/B-CFU) were enumerated in 14-day methylcellulose cultures of blood-derived nonadherent mononuclear cells incubated with BEC supernatants (BECSN) from healthy nonatopic controls (n = 8), mild atopic asthmatics (n = 9), and severe asthmatics (n = 5). Receptor-blocking antibodies were used to evaluate the contribution of alarmins. Modulation of the mRNA expression of transcription factors that are crucial for eosinophil differentiation was evaluated. BECSN stimulated the clonogenic expansion of eosinophil progenitors in vitro. In the presence of IL-5, Eo/B-CFU numbers were significantly greater in cocultures of BESCN from severe asthmatics compared with other groups. This was attenuated in the presence of a TSLP (but not an IL-33) receptor-blocking antibody. Recombinant human TSLP (optimal at 100 pg/ml) stimulated Eo/B-CFU growth, which was significantly enhanced in the presence of IL-5 (1 ng/ml). Overnight culture of CD34+ cells with IL-5 and TSLP synergistically increased GATA-binding factor 2 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α mRNA expression. The eosinophilopoietic potential of factors derived from BEC is increased in severe asthma. Our data suggest that TSLP is a key alarmin that is produced by BECs and promotes in situ eosinophilopoiesis in a type 2-rich microenvironment.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29830,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in human placentas suggest developmental origins of complex diseases.","authors":"[Shouneng, Peng][Maya A, Deyssenroth][Antonio F, Di Narzo][Luca, Lambertini][Carmen J, Marsit][Jia, Chen][Ke, Hao]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28854703","articleAbstract":"Epidemiologic studies support that at least part of the risk of chronic diseases in childhood and even adulthood may have an in utero origin, and the placenta is a key organ that plays a pivotal role in fetal growth and development.

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across all annotated transcripts were mapped and examined for enrichment for disease susceptibility loci annotated in the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) catalog. We discovered 3218 cis- and 35 trans-eQTLs at ≤10% false discovery rate in human placentas. Among the 16 439 known disease loci of genome-wide significance, 835 were placental eSNPs (enrichment fold = 1.68, P = 7.41e-42). Stronger effect sizes were observed between GWAS SNPs and gene expression in placentas than what has been reported in other tissues, such as the correlation between asthma risk allele, rs7216389-T and Gasdermin-B (GSDMB) in placenta (r2=27%) versus lung (r2=6%).

The main source of zinc exposure are fumes generated during thermal and chemical processes, mainly zinc oxide fume formed by immediate oxidation of metallic zinc vapor formed during high-temperature processes, as well as dust generated during the mechanical processing of zinc-containing materials. It is recognized that zinc ions are responsible for health effects of exposure to dust/fumes of the majority of zinc compounds, and the final effect of exposure depends on the degree of dispersion of dusts/fumes suspended in the air. Since the effects of exposure depends on the particle size, occupational exposure limits have began to be established separately for respirable and inhalable fractions. A critical effect of acute exposure to respirable fraction is a \"fume fever\" which in chronic exposure occurs as an effect associated with recurrent symptoms of acute poisoning. Impaired lung function and asthma symptoms are considered to be the main effects of exposure to inhalable fraction. Due to the limited number of the available data it is not possible to assess carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity and teratogenicity of zinc and its compounds. The aim of the study was to analyze the major health hazards resulting from occupational exposure to zinc and its inorganic compounds in the context of their physico-chemical properties, a wide range of applications and occupational exposure data.

The serum levels of IL-33, IL-37 and sVEGFR2 in the peripheral blood samples of all participants were measured by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). Flow cytometry was used to analyze the circulatory number of VEGFR2-expressing cells. The severity of MS was evaluated using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Finally, we evaluated the correlation between serum levels of those factors

 with disease severity. Our findings showed that the serum level of IL-33, IL-37, sVEGFR2 and the circulatory number of VEGFR2-expressing cells were increased in patients with MS compared to healthy subjects (p<0.0001). Also, there was a significant correlation between serum levels of these 3 factors with disease severity according to EDSS. Our study showed that the serum levels of IL-33, IL-37 and sVEGFR2 may be important prognostic biomarkers of MS.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29821,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Chemical-induced asthma and the role of clinical, toxicological, exposure and epidemiological research in regulatory and hazard characterization approaches.","authors":"[Melissa J, Vincent][Jonathan A, Bernstein][David, Basketter][Judy S, LaKind][G Scott, Dotson][Andrew, Maier]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Nov-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28866265","articleAbstract":"Uncertainties in understanding all potential modes-of-action for asthma induction and elicitation hinders design of hazard characterization and risk assessment methods that adequately screen and protect against hazardous chemical exposures. To address this challenge and identify current research needs, the University of Cincinnati and the American Cleaning Institute hosted a webinar series to discuss the current state-of-science regarding chemical-induced asthma. The general consensus is that the available database, comprised of data collected from routine clinical and validated toxicological tests, is inadequate for predicting or determining causal relationships between exposures and asthma induction for most allergens. More research is needed to understand the mechanism of asthma induction and elicitation in the context of specific chemical exposures and exposure patterns, and the impact of population variability and patient phenotypes. Validated tools to predict respiratory sensitization and to translate irritancy assays to asthma potency are needed, in addition to diagnostic biomarkers that assess and differentiate allergy versus irritant-based asthmatic responses. Diagnostic methods that encompass the diverse etiologies of asthmatic responses and incorporate robust exposure measurements capable of capturing different temporal patterns of complex chemical mixtures are needed. In the absence of ideal tools, risk assessors apply hazard-based safety assessment methods, in conjunction with active risk management, to limit potential asthma concerns, proactively identify new concerns, and ensure deployment of approaches to mitigate asthma-related risks.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29820,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Functional phenotypes determined by fluctuation-based clustering of lung function measurements in healthy and asthmatic cohort participants.","authors":"[Edgar, Delgado-Eckert][Oliver, Fuchs][Nitin, Kumar][Juha, Pekkanen][Jean-Charles, Dalphin][Josef, Riedler][Roger, Lauener][Michael, Kabesch][Maciej, Kupczyk][Sven-Erik, Dahlen][Erika von, Mutius][Urs, Frey][]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28866644","articleAbstract":"Asthma is characterised by inflammation and reversible airway obstruction.

Using enrichment analysis, we explored whether the method identifies clinically meaningful, distinct clusters of participants with different lung functional fluctuation patterns.In the PASTURE/EFRAIM dataset, we found four distinct clusters. Two clusters were enriched in children with well-known clinical characteristics of asthma. In cluster 3, children from a farming environment predominated, whereas cluster 4 mainly consisted of healthy controls. About 79% of cluster 3 carried the asthma-risk allele rs7216389 of the 17q21 locus. In the BIOAIR dataset, we found two distinct clusters clearly discriminating between individuals with mild-to-moderate and severe asthma.Our method identified dynamic functional asthma and healthy phenotypes, partly independent of atopy and inflammation but related to genetic markers on the 17q21 locus. The method can be used for disease phenotyping and possibly endotyping. It may identify participants with specific functional abnormalities, potentially needing a different therapeutic approach.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29819,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Association of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome and Transient Apical Ballooning Syndrome (Takotsubo): First Case Report of a Man and Review of the Literature.","authors":"[Stephan, Grimaldi][Emilie, Doche][Caroline, Rey][Nadia, Laksiri][Salah, Boussen][Jacques, Quilici][Emmanuelle, Robinet][Fabien, Devemy][Jean, Pelletier]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"-","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28868030","articleAbstract":"An association of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and takotsubo is rare.

Preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies have provided valuable scientific evidence for its use. This review aims to summarize reported pharmacognosy, traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacological potential of C. absus while identifying potential areas of further research of plant.The review comprises literature pertaining to the evidence base therapeutic potential, pharmacognosy and phytochemistry of C. absus spanning from 1935 to 2016 using published articles in peer-reviewed journals, ethno botanical text books, and worldwide accepted scientific databases via electronic search (Elsevier, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Web of Science, Wiley online library). Kew Botanical Garden databases and the Plant List were used to authenticate the scientific names. Different pharmacological experiments in many in-vitro and in-vivo models have proved the potential of C. absus with antihypertensive, antifertility, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-glycation, antibacterial activity, α- amylase inhibitory activity, antioxidant and reducing activitity etc. chaksine, iso-chaksine, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, chrysophanol, aloe-emodin and a wide range of chemical compounds have also been reported. Toxicity studies reveal the nontoxic nature of C. absus at a dose of 2000 mg/kg, however, plant possess reproductive toxicity and can be used as birth control or abortifacient.Reported activities suggest that there is sufficient pharmacological potential for developing C. absus as a drug for hypertension, infections, diabetes and its complications. However, heterogeneity in study protocol and conflicting results mask the ability to replicate these studies. So, future studies should be replicated in line with best practices. More toxicological studies would aid the progress to clinical trial studies.

We aimed to determine the ability of a new suggested spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) index in doing that. A random sample of 1602 schoolchildren were screened by a health questionnaire, skin prick tests, spirometry with bronchodilation and exhaled NO. A total of 662 children were included with median (IQR) exhaled NO 11(14) ppb. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using exhaled NO equations from Malmberg, Kovesi and Buchvald, and spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled NO values were applied to identify asthmatic children and uncontrolled asthma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves failed to identify asthmatic children (all AUC < 0.700). Spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled NO/FEV1 (AUC = 0.712; P = .010) and NO/FEF25%-75% (AUC = 0.735 P = .004) had a fair and increased ability to identify uncontrolled disease compared with exhaled NO (AUC = 0.707; P = .011) or the Malmberg equation (AUC = 0.701; P = .014). Sensitivity and specificity identifying non-controlled asthma were 59% and 81%, respectively, for the cut-off value of 9.7 ppb/L for exhaled NO/FEV1 , and 40% and 100% for 15.7 ppb/L/s for exhaled NO/FEF25%-75% . Exhaled NO did not allow to identify childhood asthma. Spirometry-adjusted fraction of exhaled NO performed better-assessing asthma control in children. Thus, although more validation studies are needed, we suggest its use in epidemiological studies to assess asthma control.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29803,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"The European Multicentre Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration (EMBARC): experiences from a successful ERS Clinical Research Collaboration.","authors":"[James D, Chalmers][Megan, Crichton][Pieter C, Goeminne][Michael R, Loebinger][Charles, Haworth][Marta, Almagro][Montse, Vendrell][Anthony, De Soyza][Raja, Dhar][Lucy, Morgan][Francesco, Blasi][Stefano, Aliberti][Jeanette, Boyd][Eva, Polverino]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28894479","articleAbstract":"In contrast to airway diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma, and rare diseases such as cystic fibrosis, there has been little research and few clinical trials in bronchiectasis.

Prior to accurate diagnosis, patients with PNES do not receive interventions that address the cause of their seizures and therefore incur high medical costs and disability due to an uncontrolled seizure disorder. Both seizures and comorbidities may contribute to this high cost.Based on data from 1,365 adult patients with video-electroencephalography-confirmed diagnoses from a single center, we used logistic and Poisson regression to compare the total number of comorbidities, number of medications, and presence of specific comorbidities in five mutually exclusive groups of diagnoses: epileptic seizures (ES) only, PNES only, mixed PNES and ES, physiologic nonepileptic seizurelike events, and inconclusive monitoring. To determine the diagnostic utility of comorbid diagnoses and medication history to differentiate PNES only from ES only, we used multivariate logistic regression, controlling for sex and age, trained using a retrospective database and validated using a prospective database.Our model differentiated PNES only from ES only with a prospective accuracy of 78% (95% confidence interval =72-84%) and area under the curve of 79%. With a few exceptions, the number of comorbidities and medications was more predictive than a specific comorbidity. Comorbidities associated with PNES were asthma, chronic pain, and migraines (p < 0.01). Comorbidities associated with ES were diabetes mellitus and nonmetastatic neoplasm (p < 0.01). The population-level analysis suggested that patients with mixed PNES and ES may be a population distinct from patients with either condition alone.An accurate patient-reported medical history and medication history can be useful when screening for possible PNES. Our prospectively validated and objective score may assist in the interpretation of the medication and medical history in the context of the seizure description and history.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":29801,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Phase three studies of biologics for severe asthma: could do better?","authors":"[Douglas S, Robinson][Harsha H, Kariyawasam][Liam G, Heaney]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28899938","articleAbstract":"-","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":fal

This prompted us to investigate this plant further for new potent anticancer molecules.The present study was designed to isolate and identify new promising anticancer candidates from the aqueous alcoholic extract of T. cordifolia using bioassay-guided fractionation.The structures of the isolated compounds were determined on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation and that of new potent anticancer molecule, TC-2 was confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analysis of its corresponding acetate. The in vitro anti-cancer activity of TC-2 was evaluated by SRB assay and the autophagic activity was investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy. Annexin-V FITC and PI dual staining was applied for the detection of apoptosis.

The effect of a delay in actuation following shaking on the dose available for inhalation from the spacer and the effect of a delay in extraction of aerosol from the spacer were assessed using different strengths of beclomethasone dipropionate (50 and 100 μg) and fluticasone propionate (50, 125 and 250 μg).The volumes measured by the Spacer Data Logger were in close agreement with the reference volumes of four simulated breathing patterns. A delay between shaking and actuating the pMDI resulted in a significant increase in the dose available for inhalation after only 4 seconds for the 50 and 250 μg strengths of fluticasone propionate pMDIs (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). A delay between actuation of the drug into the spacer and \"inhalation\" of aerosol from the spacer also resulted in a steady decline in the dose available from the spacer (p < 0.0001).These results confirmed the importance of using the pMDI spacer correctly by actuating directly after shaking and inhaling the aerosol from the spacer as soon after actuation as possible to optimize the dose available for inhalation.

Desmosine and isodesmosine (DES/IDES) are unique crosslinkers of mature elastin fibers and are utilized as measures of elastin degradation. The aim of this post-hoc study was to determine the effect of A1PI therapy on DES/IDES levels in patients from RAPID/RAPID Extension. Plasma levels of DES/IDES were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Correlation between changes in DES/IDES levels and computed tomography (CT) lung density decline was assessed.

Afterwards, platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced primary rat airway smooth muscle cell (ASMC) model and ovalbumin (OVA)-induced rat asthma model were used to continue our following research. Our results showed that ISOF could prolong the cough latent period, reduce the cough times in two minutes, and increase the excretion of red phenol, which suggested the antitussive and expectorant effects of ISOF. Besides, ISOF pretreatment reversed the hypotonicity and cytoskeleton remodeling in PDGF-induced ASMCs, and reduced mucus hypersecretion and collagen overdeposition in OVA-induced rat asthma model, which indicated its inhibition on airway remodeling in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ISOF reduced the invasion of inflammatory cells into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs, which revealed its inhibitory role in airway inflammation. The down-regulation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) upon ISOF treatment might be responsible for its anti-remodeling and anti-inflammation roles. In conclusion, ISOF can reduce cough and sputum, as well as inhibit airway remodeling and inflammation by regulating the expression of TGF-β1 and IL-1β. These data indicate the potency of ISOF in treating asthma and also provide insights into the development of new anti-asthma agent.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28838,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Potential Biomarkers for NSAID-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease.","authors":"[Hanki, Park][Youngwoo, Choi][Chang-Gyu, Jung][Hae-Sim, Park]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28852271","articleAbstract":"Asthma is a common chronic disease with several variant phenotypes and endotypes.

Adolescents suggested incorporating mixed activities, such as team games (e.g., rounders, football, netball), for future interventions to ensure adherence.Whilst exercise is important in the management of asthma, the tendency of those with asthma to withdraw from exercise to avoid adverse events could be addressed through a games-based high-intensity exercise intervention. Furthermore, educating all adolescents on asthma could simultaneously reduce stigmatisation and enhance exercise engagement.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28836,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Health-related quality of life in relation to disease activity in adults with hereditary angioedema in Sweden.","authors":"[Patrik, Nordenfelt][Mats, Nilsson][Anders, Lindfors][Carl-Fredrik, Wahlgren][Janne, Björkander]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"30-Nov-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28855002","articleAbstract":"Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) is impaired in patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE) but has not yet been satisfactorily described.To study HR-QoL in patients with HAE by combining different HR-QoL instruments with disease activity assessment.All adults in the Swedish HAE registry were invited to take part in this questionnaire study, which used the generic HR-QoL instruments, EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) and the RAND Corporation Short Form 36 (RAND-36), the disease-specific Angioedema Quality of Life instrument (AE-QoL), the recently introduced Angioedema Activity Score (AAS) form, and questionnaires on sick leave and prophylactic medication.Sixty-four of 133 adults (26 men, 38 women) between 18 and 91 years old responded. The most affected HR-QoL dimensions in the EQ-5D-5L were pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression; in the RAND-36, energy/fatigue, general health, pain; and, in the AE-QoL, fears/shame and fatigue/mood. Women had lower HR-QoL in the RAND-36 for general health and energy/fatigue (p < 0.05). Patients who reported any AAS of >0 had significantly impaired HR-QoL. There were significant associations (p < 0.05) between the AAS and EQ-5D-5L, between the AAS and all dimensions of the RAND-36 except physical function, and between the AAS and AE-QoL in all dimensions. Nine of 36 patients who reported sick leave during the previous 4 weeks had significantly impaired HR-QoL in all the instruments (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in HR-QoL in the patients with and the patients without prophylactic medication, except for the nutrition dimension of the AE-QoL (p < 0.05).Comprehensive information is obtained by combining different HR-QoL instruments. Pain, anxiety/depression, and fatigue/mood are important aspects of HAE but the AE-QoL disregards pain. HR-QoL was not significantly affected by prophylaxis. Increased disease activity was associated with impaired HR-QoL, which justifies more active disease managemen

Arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, is metabolized into cysteinyl leukotriene with pro-inflammatory properties for allergic inflammation, whereas the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and its downstream metabolites are known to have anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the counter-regulatory roles of EPA in inflamed lungs.Male C57BL6 mice were sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin (OVA). After EPA treatment, we evaluated the cell count of Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), mRNA expressions in the lungs by q-PCR, and the amounts of lipid mediators by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based lipidomics. We investigated the effect of the metabolite of EPA by in vivo and in vitro studies.Eicosapentaenoic acid treatment reduced the accumulation of eosinophils in the airway and decreased mRNA expression of selected inflammatory mediators in the lung. Lipidomics clarified the metabolomic profile in the lungs. Among EPA-derived metabolites, 12-hydroxy-17,18-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-OH-17,18-EpETE) was identified as one of the major biosynthesized molecules; the production of this molecule was amplified by EPA administration and allergic inflammation. Intravenous administration of 12-OH-17,18-EpETE attenuated airway eosinophilic inflammation through downregulation of C-C chemokine motif 11 (CCL11) mRNA expression in the lungs. In vitro, this molecule also inhibited the release of CCL11 from human airway epithelial cells stimulated with interleukin-4.These results demonstrated that EPA alleviated airway eosinophilic inflammation through its conversion into bioactive metabolites. Additionally, our results suggest that 12-OH-17,18-EpETE is a potential therapeutic target for the management of asthma.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28834,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Exacerbation of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia during late pregnancy and recovery after delivery: A case report and literature review.","authors":"[Jianyang, Lu][Hongbo, Zhai]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Sep-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28858117","articleAbstract":"Primary intestinal lymphangiectasia (PIL) is a rare disease characterized by dilated intestinal lacteals resulting in lymph leakage into the small bowel lumen.

She reported strict adherence to low-fat/high-protein diet with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) supplementation. She was general well except for moderate edema and hypoalbuminemia. At 33 weeks, she developed diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, with decreased fetal movements. One week later, she had an asthma attack. Nonstress test showed frequent variable deceleration.The diagnosis of PIL was established endoscopically 8 years earlier.Hypoalbuminemia was corrected with intravenous albumin administration. She also received corticosteroid therapy to promote fetal lung maturation in anticipation to early termination of the pregnancy.A cesarean section was carried out at 34 weeks due to fetal distress. The baby girl was apparently healthy: weighing 2160 g, with an Apgar score of 9 at both 1 and 5 minutes. Symptoms dissipated rapidly after the delivery. The last follow-up visit at 15 months was unremarkable for both the mother and infant.PIL could be compatible with pregnancy, but requires strict adherence to dietary treatment, proper management of the symptoms (e.g., hypoalbuminemia), particularly during late gestation.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28833,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Selective release of miRNAs via extracellular vesicles is associated with house-dust mite allergen-induced airway inflammation.","authors":"[Y, Gon][S, Maruoka][T, Inoue][K, Kuroda][K, Yamagishi][Y, Kozu][S, Shikano][K, Soda][J, Lötvall][S, Hashimoto]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Dec-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28859242","articleAbstract":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may facilitate cell-to-cell communication via extracellular vesicles (EVs). The biological roles of miRNAs in EVs on allergic airway inflammation are unclear.Airway-secreted EVs (AEVs) were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of control and house-dust mite (HDM) allergen-exposed HDM-sensitized mice. The expression of miRNAs in AEVs or miRNAs and mRNAs in lung tissue was analysed using miRNA microarray.The amount of AEV increased 8.9-fold in BALF from HDM-exposed mice compared with that from sham-control mice. HDM exposure resulted in significant changes in the expression of 139 miRNAs in EVs and 175 miRNAs in lung tissues, with 54 miRNAs being common in both samples. Expression changes of these 54 miRNAs between miRNAs in AEVs and lung tissues after HDM exposure were inversely correlated. Computational analysis revealed that 31 genes, including IL-13 and IL-5Ra, are putative targets of the miRNAs up-regulated in AEVs but down-regulated in lung tissues after HDM exposure. The amount of AEV in BALF after HDM exposure was diminished by treatment with the sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869. The treatment with GW4869 also decreased Th2 cytokines and eosinophil counts in BALFs and reduced eosinophil accumulation in airway walls and mucosa.These results indicate that selective sorting of miRNA including Th2 inhibitory miRNAs into AEVs and increase release to the airway after HDM exposure would be involved in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28832,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"β2-Adrenoreceptor is a regulator of the α-synuclein gene driving risk of Parkinson's disease.","authors":"[Shuchi, Mittal][Kjetil, Bjørnevik][Doo Soon, Im][Adrian, Flierl][Xianjun, Dong][Joseph J, Locascio][Kristine M, Abo][Elizabeth, Long][Ming, Jin][Bing, Xu][Yang K, Xiang][Jean-Christophe, Rochet][Anders, Engeland][Patrizia, Rizzu][Peter, Heutink][Tim, Bartels][Dennis J, Selkoe][Barbara J, Caldarone][Marcie A, Glicksman][Vikram, Khurana][Birgitt, Schüle][David S, Park][Trond, Riise][Clemens R, Scherzer]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Se

Using an unbiased screen targeting endogenous gene expression, we discovered that the β2-adrenoreceptor (β2AR) is a regulator of the α-synuclein gene (SNCA). β2AR ligands modulate SNCA transcription through histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation of its promoter and enhancers. Over 11 years of follow-up in 4 million Norwegians, the β2AR agonist salbutamol, a brain-penetrant asthma medication, was associated with reduced risk of developing PD (rate ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.76). Conversely, a β2AR antagonist correlated with increased risk. β2AR activation protected model mice and patient-derived cells. Thus, β2AR is linked to transcription of α-synuclein and risk of PD in a ligand-specific fashion and constitutes a potential target for therapies.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Review Required","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Validated Observation","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Non-Validated Observation","closed":true,"isClosed":false}]}

We hypothesized that regular exercise improves asthma control among young adults.We studied 162 subjects with current asthma recruited from a population-based cohort study of 1,623 young adults 20-27 years of age. Asthma control was assessed by the occurrence of asthma-related symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and phlegm production, during the past 12 months. Asthma symptom score was calculated based on reported frequencies of these symptoms (range: 0-12). Exercise was assessed as hours/week.In Poisson regression, adjusting for gender, age, smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and education, the asthma symptom score reduced by 0.09 points per 1 hour of exercise/week (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.17). Applying the \"Low exercise\" quartile as the reference, \"Medium exercise\" reduced the asthma symptom score by 0.66 (-0.39 to 1.72), and \"High exercise\" reduced it significantly by 1.13 (0.03 to 2.22). The effect was strongest among overweight subjects.Our results provide new evidence that regular exercising among young adults improves their asthma control. Thus, advising about exercise should be included as an important part of asthma self-management in clinical practice.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":28842,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Development of an Intelligent Spacer Data Logger System.","authors":"[Chris, O'Callaghan][Nicholas J, Smith][Peter W, Barry][John, Denyer]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Dec-2017","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28846487","articleAbstract":"Although delivery of drugs from pressurized metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) via spacer devices is widespread it cannot be assumed that patients take their medication as prescribed or use their spacer appropriately. We developed a Spacer Data Logger device to record patient adherence and whether patients had shaken the pMDI, actuated it soon after shaking, and inhaled a sufficient volume from it.We report an assessment of the Spacer Data Logger to measure and record that the pMDI was adequately shaken, the time to actuation, and the volume \"inhaled\" from the spacer up to 26 seconds after actuation. The effect of a delay in actuation following shaking on the dose available for inhalation from the spacer and the effect of a delay in extraction of aerosol from the spacer were assessed using different strengths of beclomethasone dipropionate (50 and 100 μg) and fluticasone propionate (50, 125 and 250 μg).The volumes measured by the Spacer Data Logger were in close agreement with the reference volumes of four simulated breathing patterns. A delay between shaking and actuating the pMDI resulted in a significant increase in the dose available for inhalation after only 4 seconds for the 50 and 250 μg strengths of fluticasone propionate pMDIs (p = 0.004 and p < 0.001, respectively). A delay between actuation of the drug into the spacer and \"inhalation\" of aerosol from the spacer also resulted in a steady decline in the dose available from the spacer (p < 0.0001).These results confirmed the importance of using the pMDI spacer correctly by actuating directly after shaking and inhaling the aerosol from the spacer as soon after actuation as possible to optimize the dose available for inhalation. The Spacer Data Logger should be a useful tool to determine adherence to and \"optimum\" use of pMDI spacers in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":22864,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Validity of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and small airway function indices in diagnosis of cough-variant asthma.","authors":"[Chen, Feng-Jia][Huang, Xin-Yan][Lin, Geng-Peng][Liu, Yang-Li][Xie, Can-Mao]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Jul-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28846444","articleAbstract":"Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a non-invasive method used to reveal the eosinophilic inflammation of airway and to diagnose and manage asthma. The use of FeNO measurement or its combination with the small airway function in differentiating CVA patients from chronic cough patients is unexplored.From December 2012 to June 2016, patients with chronic non-productive cough for more than 8 weeks based on physician's opinion were subjected to FeNO, pulmonary function, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) tests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were obtained to evaluate the clinical value of FeNO and small airways indices in CVA diagnosis. The optimal cutoff point for the level of FeNO was also determined.The FeNO value in the CVA group was significantly higher than that in the non-cough-variant asthma (NCVA) group [42(41) parts per billion (ppb) vs. (16(11) ppb), P < 0.05]. The area under the ROC curve was estimated to be 0.874 for FeNO. An optimal cutoff point of 25 ppb had respective sensitivity and specificity values of 81.3% and 84.0% in differentiating CVA patients from NCVA patients. The CVA group showed small airway dysfunction, and the small airway resistance was significantly higher than in the NCVA group. The area under the ROC curve of FeNO combined with maximal midexpiratory flow (MEF) (% predicted) was 0.883, and that combined with MEF50 (% predicted) was 0.886.The measurement of FeNO is a non-invasive, reproducible, and sensitive method of differentiating CVA patients from NCVA patients. A combination of the level of FeNO (25 ppb) and the abnormal small airway function suggested higher CVA possibility, thereby resulting in a rapid diagnosis. Unnecessary treatments are avoided. This finding provides a new perspective for the management of patients with CVA.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":21864,"alertName":"Lit-Asthma","priority":{"value":"Medium","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-m-circle blue-1"},"title":"Utilization of just-in-time training for nursing education using the LA Phonospirometry asthma tool.","authors":"[Kathryn H, Pade][Sophia T, Seik-Ismail][Todd P, Chang][Vincent J, Wang]","assignedTo":{"id":258,"fullName":"Signal Dev","username":"signaldev","email":"amit.aggarwal1@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Jul-2018","disposition":"New","productName":null,"eventName":"Asthma","actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":19818,"articleId":"28846445","articleAbstract":"Just-in-time training (JITT) has been used to teach and re-teach known medical techniques, but has not been used to teach novel techniques.

A checklist was used to evaluate proficiency with the primary outcome being the number correct on the checklist. The secondary outcome included whether or not they could identify a common error demonstrated by the RA. RNs were re-tested after 4-6 months to assess skill retention.Forty RNs were enrolled in the study and six were lost to follow-up. The mean time from the first to second testing was 5.4 months ± 0.5 months. The mean score of the first part of the checklist on the initial testing was 4.6 ± 0.7 and on second testing was 3.8 ± 1.5 (p = 0.008). This represented a drop in scores and thus minimal knowledge decay of 18% (from 91% to 73%).

Obesity may worsen asthma, although the mechanism is poorly understood and its effects on different subtypes are not well characterized. We sought to determine whether obesity affects eosinophilic asthma differently from non-eosinophilic asthma.Charts of 196 persistent asthmatics were reviewed. Subjects were categorized according to BMI (obese ≥ 30 kg/m2) and blood eosinophilia based on two different cutoffs (≥200 or ≥400 cells/µl): eosinophilic, non-obese (E-NO), eosinophilic, obese (E-O), non-eosinophilic, non-obese (NE-NO), and non-eosinophilic, obese (NE-O). We analyzed clinical parameters across these groups to determine associations with obesity and/or eosinophilia.Obesity was highly prevalent in our population (50.5%, 99/196). The majority of asthmatics were female (75.5%), though the ratio was lower in the E-NO group (56%). The NE-NO group was associated with lowest asthma severity, lower atopy, and less medication use. Regardless of eosinophilia, obesity was associated with higher inhaled corticosteroid doses and lower FVC% predicted than their non-obese counterparts. Obesity was associated with reduced FEV1% only in the non-eosinophilic group. Eosinophilia was also associated with reduced FEV1% in the non-obese subjects, but FEV1% was not further reduced in the E-O group compared to the E-NO and NE-O groups. Similar findings were observed regardless of whether the blood eosinophil cutoff was 200 or 400 cells/ µl.Multiple clinical features of asthma are adversely affected by obesity, which may affect eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic subtypes differently.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Review Required","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Validated Observation","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Non-Validated Observation","closed":true,"isClosed":false}]}

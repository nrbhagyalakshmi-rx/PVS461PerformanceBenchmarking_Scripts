We hypothesized that regular exercise improves asthma control among young adults.We studied 162 subjects with current asthma recruited from a population-based cohort study of 1,623 young adults 20-27 years of age. Asthma control was assessed by the occurrence of asthma-related symptoms, including wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and phlegm production, during the past 12 months. Asthma symptom score was calculated based on reported frequencies of these symptoms (range: 0-12). Exercise was assessed as hours/week.In Poisson regression, adjusting for gender, age, smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and education, the asthma symptom score reduced by 0.09 points per 1 hour of exercise/week (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.17). Applying the \"Low exercise\" quartile as the reference, \"Medium exercise\" reduced the asthma symptom score by 0.66 (-0.39 to 1.72), and \"High exercise\" reduced it significantly by 1.13 (0.03 to 2.22). The effect was strongest among overweight subjects.Our results provide new evidence that regular exercising among young adults improves their asthma control. Thus, advising about exercise should be included as an important part of asthma self-management in clinical practice.","execConfigId":19847,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Review Required","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Validated Observation","closed":false,"isClosed":false},{"value":"Non-Validated Observation","closed":true,"isClosed":false}]}

The present study investigated the incidence and determined the prognostic significance of hypoalbuminaemia in patients with confirmed acute PE.From a dedicated tertiary-referral centre database involving 1,426 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed PE (2000-2012), 1,032 patients had serum albumin assessed on admission (day-1). Patients were stratified into hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g/L) or normal serum albumin (≥35 g/L). Multivariable logistic and Cox proportional-hazards regression methods were used to assess 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality.Hypoalbuminaemia was present in 160 (15.5%) patients at day-1 and was associated with higher mean (±SD) heart rate (94.4 ± 21.8 vs 87.8 ± 21.5 bpm), lower systolic blood pressure (131.0 ± 24.7 vs 142.3 ± 24.7 mmHg), lower arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation (93.3 ± 6.1% vs 95.6 ± 4.0%), lower day-1 serum sodium (137.0 ± 4.7 vs 138.8 ± 3.8 mmol/L) and haemoglobin levels (114.4 ± 20.7 vs 131.5 ± 18.7 g/L). Patients with hypoalbuminaemia had higher incidence of malignancy (44.4% vs 18.8%) and chronic renal disease (9.4% vs 5.2%), and at admission were less likely to be taking aspirin/clopidogrel (19.3% vs 27.7%) and more likely to be using enoxaparin (6.7% vs 3.0%). During a mean follow-up of 5.0 ± 4.0 years, patients with hypoalbuminaemia had higher 30-day (16.3% vs 3.6%) and 90-day (26.3% vs 6.2%) mortality.

Thrombogenesis in MPN involves multiple cellular mechanisms, including platelet activation and neutrophil-extracellular trap formation; therefore, an antithrombotic agent that targets one or more of these processes would be of therapeutic benefit in MPN. Here, we treated the JAK2V617F knockin mouse model of polycythemia vera with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a sulfhydryl-containing compound with broad effects on glutathione replenishment, free radical scavenging, and reducing disulfide bonds, to investigate its antithrombotic effects in the context of MPN. Strikingly, NAC treatment extended the lifespan of JAK2V617F mice without impacting blood counts or splenomegaly. Using an acute pulmonary thrombosis model in vivo, we found that NAC reduced thrombus formation to a similar extent as the irreversible platelet inhibitor aspirin. In vitro analysis of platelet activation revealed that NAC reduced thrombin-induced platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation in JAK2V617F mice. Furthermore, NAC reduced neutrophil extracellular trap formation in primary human neutrophils from patients with MPN as well as healthy controls. These results provide evidence that N-acetylcysteine inhibits thrombosis in JAK2V617F mice and provide a pre-clinical rationale for investigating NAC as a therapeutic to reduce thrombotic risk in MPN.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55917,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Ischemic Stroke and Bleeding: Clinical Benefit of Anticoagulation in Atrial Fibrillation After Intracerebral Hemorrhage.","authors":"[Robert J, Stanton][Mark H, Eckman][Daniel, Woo][Charles J, Moomaw][Mary, Haverbusch][Matthew L, Flaherty][Dawn O, Kleindorfer]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"31-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"32000590","articleAbstract":"Background and Purpose- Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and atrial fibrillation (AF) are at risk for ischemic events. While risk calculators (CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED) have been validated to assess risk for ischemic stroke and major bleeding in AF patients, decisions about anticoagulation must consider the net clinical benefit of anticoagulation. Furthermore, stroke and bleeding risk are highly correlated, making decisions more difficult. Methods- We examined patients in the GERFHS III study (Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Hemorrhagic Stroke)-a population-based retrospective study of spontaneous ICH patients without a structural or traumatic cause in the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky region between July 2008 and December 2012. CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-B(L)ED (minus L because labile international normalized ratio was unavailable) scores were calculated for ICH patients with AF. Using a Markov state transition model, we estimated net clinical benefit of anticoagulation relative to no treatment in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We defined minimal clinically relevant benefit as 0.1 QALYs. Results- Among 1186 cases of spontaneous ICH, 95 cases had AF and met our survival criteria. Within 1 year, 8 of 95 (8%) would be expected to have a major bleeding event on anticoagulation, and 5 of 95 (5%) of patients would be expected to have an ischemic stroke off anticoagulation. Sixty-eight of 95 (71%) patients would have higher risk for major bleeding than for ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation with directly acting anticoagulants would result in no clinically significant gain or loss in 73%. Roughly 12% would gain >0.1 QALYs, and 15% would lose >0.1 QALYs. Among patients receiving aspirin, most have no significant net clinical benefit or loss. Overall, anticoagulation of the entire cohort would result in an aggregate loss of 0.92 QALYs. Conclusions- Our analysis suggests that universal anticoagulation after ICH would be associated with a net loss of QALY. Additional factors should be considered before anticoagulating patients with AF after ICH. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

To demonstrate that aspirin has a better effect on the CRC of PIK3CA mutations in association with the PI3K/Akt/Raptor pathway, we used aspirin to treat PIK3CA mutant CRC cells (HCT-116 and RKO). Subsequently, the CCK8 assay and flow cytometry assay were used to detect the apoptosis of PIK3CA mutant CRC cells before and after aspirin use.

We therefore sought to compare the efficacy and safety among DOACs for secondary prevention of VTE. We also determined a risk-adapted threshold for initiating extended anticoagulation based on the likelihood of VTE recurrence (without treatment) and bleeding (with treatment) in patients with unprovoked VTE.Our systematic review of randomized controlled trials compares extended anticoagulation with DOACs to another DOAC, aspirin, or placebo for the prevention of recurrent VTE.

We used network meta-analysis to make indirect comparisons among DOACs.

Given that the risk of VTE recurrence is much higher than the calculated threshold for treatment, extended thromboprophylaxis should be considered in all patients with unprovoked VTE who do not have increased bleeding risk.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55909,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Gastrointestinal and uterine smooth muscles relaxant and anti-inflammatory effects of corchorus olitorius leaf extract in laboratory animal models.","authors":"[Daniel, Orieke][Obioma Christopher, Ohaeri][Ifeoma Irene, Ijeh][Solomon Nnah, Ijioma]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"30-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31509779","articleAbstract":"Corchorus olitorius is reportedly used in ethno-medicine to arrest threatened miscarriage and other conditions associated with excessive uterine contractions.

Anti-inflammatory study was carried out via the egg albumin-induced paw edema model in rats.The application of COLE to pieces of uterine tissue significantly decreased the amplitudes of contractions in a dose dependent manner such that the highest dose applied (666.67 μg/ml) achieved a 100% inhibitory effect. Oxytocin induced contractions were also significantly inhibited by both salbutamol and COLE. On the isolated rabbit jejunum, the effect of COLE was also inhibitory and like atropine, significantly inhibited acetylcholine induced contractions. In the in vivo study, the extract inhibited charcoal meal movement in test rats when compared with control. Anti-inflammatory effect of COLE was significant and compared favourably with that of aspirin following in vivo trials.COLE therefore, may be a good tocolytic, anti-diarrheal and anti-inflammatory agent and offers hope of new drug discovery for such uses.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55908,"alertN

The primary outcome of interest was bleeding, defined per the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC). Secondary outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACE); defined as all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction or stroke, the individual component of MACE and stent thrombosis. A total of 4 RCTs with 29,089 patients were included. There was significant reduction in BARC 2,3 or 5 bleeding events in patients who were treated with aspirin free strategy versus DAPT (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-, p = 0.03, I2 = 89%). Moreover, although there was a trend of reduced major bleeding (BARC 3 or 5) outcomes in the aspirin free strategy group compared to the DAPT group, this did not achieve statistical significance (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.37-1.06, p = 0.08, I2 = 795). Additionally, there was no difference between the aspirin free strategy and DAPT in term of MACE (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.82-1.03, p = 0.13, I2 = 0%), all-cause mortality (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77-1.04, p = 0.15, I2 = 0%), MI (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74-1.08, p = 0.24, I2 = 0%), stroke (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.65-1.99, p = 0.66, I2 = 60%) or stent thrombosis (HR 0.1.01, 95% CI 0.83-1.22, p = 0.93, I2 = 0%).

The injured segment of the VA was exposed, and the platelet plug over the injured VA was identified. The proximal and distal ends of the injured segment were temporarily clipped, and the platelet plug was removed, revealing a small, ovoid-shaped' full-thickness arterial wall defect. The VA injury was repaired with simple running 10-0 nylon sutures. Indocyanine green angiography confirmed rapid filling of the patent lumen. The corpectomy and anterior fixation were completed.

However, the mode of action (MOA) of BBR remains to be clarified. At a cellular level, the inhibitory effect of BBR on mitochondrial enzymes is probably responsible for many of its biological activities, including the activation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and insulin receptor (InsR); these biological activities contribute to ameliorate peripheral blood metabolic profiles, e.g. by reducing plasma lipids and glucose levels, thus improving signs and symptoms of metabolic disorders. In this perspective, BBR acts as a targeted therapy. However, it also exerts pleiotropic systemic activities on some root causes of CDs that include antioxidant / anti-inflammatory effects and modifications of gut microbiota composition and metabolism, which may also contribute to its disease-modifying effects. After reviewing the different MOA of BBR, here we propose that BBR acts through a drug-cloud (dCloud) mechanism, as different to a drug-target effect. The dCloud here is defined as a group of terminal molecular events induced by the drug (or/and related metabolites), as well as the network connections among them. In this scenario, the therapeutic efficacy of BBR is the result of its dCloud effect acting on symptoms/signs as well as on root causes of the diseases. The dCloud concept is applicable to other established MTDs, such as aspirin, metformin, statins as well as to nutrient starvation, thus providing a novel instrument for the design of effective therapies against multifactorial metabolism-related CDs.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55898,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Evaluation of antitumor effects of aspirin and LGK974 drugs on cellular signaling pathways, cell cycle and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines compared to oxaliplatin drug.","authors":"[Malihe, Bagheri][Mohamad Amin, Tabatabae Far][Hamed, Mirzaei][Faezeh, Ghasemi]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposi

The analysis of the results demonstrated that aspirin and LGK974 have cytotoxic effects on CRC cell lines, and in the IC50 dose, they disintegrate the cancerous cell masses. These drugs reduce the invasion and increase apoptosis in SW742 and SW480 cell lines. A decrease in the expression of WNT, AXIN, TCF and APC genes and an increase in the expression of β-catenin gene in the WNT signaling pathway were revealed. The genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway such as ERK, JNK, KRAS and MEK showed a decrease in expression and a increase in expression of RAF gene. In the apoptotic pathway, increased expression of BAX and decreased expression of BCL-2 were reported. Also, decreased expression of P53, cyclin D1 and COX-2 was observed.

The expressions of mRNA androgen receptor (AR) gene in the ovary were determined by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). All the data was analyzed using one way ANOVA with the Graph pad prism software version 6. A p<0.05 was considered significant.The results obtained showed that dehydroepiandrosterone treatment caused significant decrease (p<0.05) in total protein, superoxide Dismutase (SOD), glutathione-s- transferase (GST), Ca2+ ATPase, and significant increase (p<0.05) in malondialdehyde, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor and estrogen as compared to Controls. The group co-administered with DHEA and aspirin showed significant increases in SOD, GST, CAT, GSH, Progesterone, Ca2+ ATPase, Na+ ATPase, H+ ATPase and significant reduction (p<0.05) in malondialdehyde, VEGF, TNF-α and estrogen as compared with the DHEA group. The histopathological analysis showed reductions in cystic fibrosis, atretic ovaries, increased expression of Bcl-2 and E- Cadherin and reduced Bax expression in the group that received Aspirin and DHEA.This study clearly demonstrates that Aspirin has ameliorating effects against polycystic ovary syndrome via anti-inflammatory and hormonal modulatory pathways.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55896,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Effect of aspirin on semen quality: A review.","authors":"[Saleem A, Banihani]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31762091","articleAbstract":"According to the PubMed data base, there are at least fifty published articles that link between aspirin and semen quality.

Still, clinical studies that directly examine the effect of aspirin on the main semen quality parameters are needed to support this conclusion. Mechanistically, the negative documented effect of aspirin on semen quality parameters may be attributable to decreased synthesis of testosterone, reduced function of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, decreased formation of testicular prostaglandins, reduced production of seminal nitric oxide and increased oxidative injury to sperm.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55895,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Rationale and design of \"Can Very Low Dose Rivaroxaban (VLDR) in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy improve thrombotic status in acute coronary syndrome (VaLiDate-R)\" study : A randomised trial modulating endogenous fibrinolysis in patients with acute coronary syndrome.","authors":"[Ying X, Gue][Rahim, Kanji][David M, Wellsted][Manivannan, Srinivasan][Solange, Wyatt][Diana A, Gorog]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31872349","articleAbstract":"Impaired endogenous fibrinolysis is novel biomarker that can identify patients with ACS at increased cardiovascular risk.

Data indicate that long-term intake of low-dose aspirin reduces the risk of CRC; however, the mechanisms underlying this chemopreventive effect are still unclear. Different mouse models for inflammation-associated, sporadic, and hereditary CRC were applied to assess the efficacy and mechanism of low-dose aspirin on tumor prevention. An initial dosing study performed in healthy mice indicates that aspirin at a dose of 25 mg/kg/d has a similar pharmacodynamic effect as low-dose aspirin treatment in human subjects (100 mg/d). Chronic low-dose aspirin treatment suppresses colitis-associated and to a lesser extent spontaneous tumorigenesis in mice. Aspirin's antitumor effect is most pronounced in a preventive approach when aspirin administration starts before the tumor-initiating genotoxic event and continues for the duration of the experiment. These effects are not associated with alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis, or activation of signaling pathways involved in CRC. Aspirin-induced reduction in tumor burden is accompanied by inhibition of thromboxane B2 formation, indicating reduced platelet activation. Aspirin treatment also results in decreased colonic prostaglandin E2 formation and tumor angiogenesis. With respect to colitis-triggered tumorigenesis, aspirin administration is associated with a reduction in inflammatory activity in the colon, as indicated by decreased levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, and tumor-associated iNOS-positive macrophages. Our results suggest that low-dose aspirin represents an effective antitumor agent in the context of colon tumorigenesis primarily due to its well-established cyclooxygenase inhibition effects.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55893,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Thromboelastography parameters in Italian pregnant women: do antithrombotic drugs change reference values?","authors":"[Giovanni Luca, Tiscia][Antonio, De Laurenzo][Filomena, Cappucci][Giovanni, Favuzzi][Elena, Chinni][Pasquale, Vaira][Angelo, Ostuni][Maurizio, Margaglione][Elvira, Grandone]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"29-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"32001491","articleAbstract":"This study was carried out to explore hemostasis modifications occurring in pregnant women and thromboelastography profiles in those taking antithrombotic drugs.

High on-aspirin platelet reactivity (HAPR) is associated with increased risk for deleterious cardiovascular events. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between HAPR and albumin levels in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with aspirin. Patients with known stable CAD, who were taking aspirin (75 to 100 mg qd) regularly for at least 1 month, were screened for the present study. Exclusion criteria: cancer, sepsis or acute infection, active inflammatory/rheumatic disease, recent major surgery, chronic liver failure, the administration of other antiplatelet drugs, nonadherence with aspirin and thrombocytopenia. Blood was drawn from the participants and sent for SA level and platelet function test (VerifyNow). HAPR was defined as aspirin reaction units (ARU) >550. Overall 116 patients were analyzed; age 69 ± 10, 28% women. Twenty (17%) were hypoalbuminemic (≤3.5 g/dl). Hypoalbuminemic patients had similar characteristics to the normal albumin group except mildly higher creatinine in the former. SA levels were significantly lower in the hypoalbuminemic group (3.2 ± 0.2 g/dl vs 4.2 ± 0.4 g/dl, respectively, p <0.001) whereas mean ARU was significantly higher compared with the normal albumin group (548 ± 45 vs 444 ± 66 ARU, respectively, p <0.001). A significant inverse association was observed between SA and ARU with (R2 = 0.67, p <0.001). Multivariate analysis adjusted for potential confounders found that albumin ≤3.5 is the strongest predictor of HAPR in patients with stable CAD (hazards ratio 4.9, 95% confidence interval 2.2 to 32, p = 0.002).

By contrast, the benefit-to-risk ratio of aspirin use in primary prevention is debated: three contemporary randomized control trials have been conflicting, and meta-analyses have concluded for an unclear clinical benefit, based on the consideration that the reduction in thromboembolic events is counterbalanced by increased bleeding. The primary prevention setting is, however, a heterogeneous mix of subjects at highly variable cardiovascular risk. One possible explanation for the uncertainty of data interpretation is the progressive reduction in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in primary prevention that has accompanied global education programs, leading patients to smoke less, exercise more, and increasingly take lipid-lowering therapies. Based on a meta-regression of the benefits and harm of aspirin therapy in primary prevention as a function of the 10-year risk of MACE, we favor a nuanced approach still, however, based on the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, acknowledging differences between patients and emphasizing an individualized assessment of both benefits and harm. After optimal control of cardiovascular risk factors, and when patients are less than 70 years of age, clinicians should assess the risk of MACE and base decision on such stratification, considering the risk of bleeding and patient preferences. Clinicians would then advise the use of aspirin in primary prevention patients at the highest risk of MACE who do not have a prohibitive risk of bleeding, and in the majority of cases after initiation of properly titrated statin therapy.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55882,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Effect of Simvastatin Use in Free Tissue Transfer: An Experimental Study in a Rat Epigastric Free Flap Model.","authors":"[Usama, Abdelfattah][Tarek, Elbanoby][Eun Na, Kim][Eun Jung, Park][Hyunsuk Peter, Suh][Joon Pio Jp, Hong]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"29-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"31995818","articleAbstract":" Statins are traditionally used in lowering cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein biosynthesis, but recent reports show their beneficial effect on microcirculation.

Bilateral free epigastric skin flap was used to evaluate the effect. At 48 hours, flaps biopsies were evaluated for inflammatory activity, nitric oxide content, and thrombomodulin regulation in the endothelial lining of microvessels. Flap survival was evaluated on day 7. The diameter of microvessels and nitric oxide activity in groups B and C were significantly higher than in group A (p < 0.005 and 0.015, respectively). The perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates and intravascular adhesions were predominant in group A compared with groups B and C (p < 0.005). Groups B and C demonstrated significant higher degree of thrombomodulin expression. The flap survival rate on day 7 was 70.8% for group A, and 87.5% and 91.7%, respectively, for groups B and C without significance between the two (p = 0.675). Simvastatin significantly improves the free flap survival by effective anti-inflammatory, vasodilator, and anticoagulant activities.

Our aim was to assess whether drug prescription for STEMI patients was in accordance with the guidelines at discharge and after 1 year.We used data of 361 patients admitted for STEMI in a tertiary hospital in Switzerland from 2014 to 2016. We assessed the adequacy of prescription of recommended drugs at two time points: discharge and after 1 year. Medications assessed were aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and β-blockers. We took into account several criteria like statin dosage (low versus high intensity) and presence of contraindication for consideration of optimal therapy. Predictors of incomplete prescription of guideline medications were then assessed with multivariate logistic regression models.From discharge (n = 358) to 1-year follow-up (n = 303), rate of optimal prescription was reduced from 98.6 to 91.7% for aspirin, from 93.9 to 79.1% for P2Y12 inhibitors, from 83.8 to 65.7% for statins, from 98.6 to 95.6% for ACEIs/ARBs, and from 97.1 to 96.9% for β-blockers. Predictors of incomplete prescription of guideline medications at discharge were female sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.54, p = 0.007), active or former smoker status (OR 2.29, p = 0.017), multivessel disease (OR 2.07, p = 0.022), left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% (OR 2.49, p = 0.008), and transfer to cardiac surgery (OR 9.66, p = 0.018). At 1 year, age > 65 (OR 1.92, p = 0.036) remained the only significant predictor.The present study showed a high prescription rate of guideline-recommended medications in a referral center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. At discharge, women and co-morbid patients were at the highest risk of incomplete prescription of guideline medications, whereas long-term prescription was suboptimal for elderly. A drug lacking at time of discharge was rarely introduced within the year, which underscores the paramount importance of optimal prescription at time of discharge. Strategies like implementing a standardized prescription could reduce the proportion of suboptimal prescription. It could therefore be one way to improve the long-term quality of care of our patients to the highest level.

Furthermore, the content of the active ingredient can be determined with an error of 10%.

RECENT FINDINGS: The COMPASS trial challenged prior recommendations regarding anticoagulation in PAD.

The THEMIS trial showed a 55% risk reduction for MALE with ticagrelor DAPT compared with aspirin monotherapy (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.23-0.86).

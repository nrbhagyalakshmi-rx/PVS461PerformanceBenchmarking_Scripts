The present study investigated the incidence and determined the prognostic significance of hypoalbuminaemia in patients with confirmed acute PE.From a dedicated tertiary-referral centre database involving 1,426 consecutive patients admitted with confirmed PE (2000-2012), 1,032 patients had serum albumin assessed on admission (day-1). Patients were stratified into hypoalbuminaemia (<35 g/L) or normal serum albumin (≥35 g/L). Multivariable logistic and Cox proportional-hazards regression methods were used to assess 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality.Hypoalbuminaemia was present in 160 (15.5%) patients at day-1 and was associated with higher mean (±SD) heart rate (94.4 ± 21.8 vs 87.8 ± 21.5 bpm), lower systolic blood pressure (131.0 ± 24.7 vs 142.3 ± 24.7 mmHg), lower arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation (93.3 ± 6.1% vs 95.6 ± 4.0%), lower day-1 serum sodium (137.0 ± 4.7 vs 138.8 ± 3.8 mmol/L) and haemoglobin levels (114.4 ± 20.7 vs 131.5 ± 18.7 g/L). Patients with hypoalbuminaemia had higher incidence of malignancy (44.4% vs 18.8%) and chronic renal disease (9.4% vs 5.2%), and at admission were less likely to be taking aspirin/clopidogrel (19.3% vs 27.7%) and more likely to be using enoxaparin (6.7% vs 3.0%). During a mean follow-up of 5.0 ± 4.0 years, patients with hypoalbuminaemia had higher 30-day (16.3% vs 3.6%) and 90-day (26.3% vs 6.2%) mortality. Multivariable analyses showed hypoalbuminaemia independently predicted both 30-day (odds ratio 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-6.41) and 90-day (hazard ratio 2.42 95% CI 1.38-4.22) mortality.Hypoalbuminaemia is an independent predictor of mortality following PE and may improve risk stratification of patients in risk prediction models.","execConfigId":55850,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":55916,"alertName":"literature1","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Contemporary analysis of otolaryngic allergy.","authors":"[Willard C, Harrill][Gavin, Setzen][Douglas, Farquhar][Harold C, Pillsbury]","assignedTo":{"id":7052,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"ASPIRIN","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":55723,"articleId":"30982993","articleAbstract":"Investigate the current trends in otolaryngic allergy (OA).Cross-sectional survey.Survey of active AAOA membership.Response rate was 27.3%. Regional response distribution rates were proportional to the AAOA membership distribution within the United States (R2 = 0.95; P < 0.001), with no significant regional response bias demonstrated (P = 0.428). Self-reported duration to OA competency was 5.8 years. Physicians reporting OA competency were more likely to be board-certified (P < 0.001) and have AAOA fellowship status (P < 0.001). The AAOA was reported to be the most valuable educational resource toward achieving OA competency, with residency training being least valuable (P < 0.001). 91.5% of respondents' practices offered OA services. Subcutaneous injections predominated at twice the utilization of sublingual immunotherapy. Allergy immunotherapy tablets were rarely utilized. Home allergy shots were offered by 45.2% of respondents. In-office immunotherapy vial compounding was preferred (95.8%) to third-party vendors. 94% of AAOA respondents identified patient compliance to be an issue within OA. Non-inhalant allergy service integration included food allergy (63.5%), asthma (44.9%), allergic fungal sinusitis (43.8%), penicillin allergy (18%), stinging insect allergy (12.6%), and aspirin desensitization (3.9%).Reported duration to OA competency after residency was surprisingly long. Further investigation of current and future educational/clinical training is warranted given clinical integration reported for OA.

Our aim was to assess whether drug prescription for STEMI patients was in accordance with the guidelines at discharge and after 1 year.We used data of 361 patients admitted for STEMI in a tertiary hospital in Switzerland from 2014 to 2016. We assessed the adequacy of prescription of recommended drugs at two time points: discharge and after 1 year. Medications assessed were aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitors, statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and β-blockers. We took into account several criteria like statin dosage (low versus high intensity) and presence of contraindication for consideration of optimal therapy. Predictors of incomplete prescription of guideline medications were then assessed with multivariate logistic regression models.From discharge (n = 358) to 1-year 
e1a
follow-up (n = 303), rate of optimal prescription was reduced from 98.6 to 91.7% for aspirin, from 93.9 to 79.1% for P2Y12 inhibitors, from 83.8 to 65.7% for statins, from 98.6 to 95.6% for ACEIs/ARBs, and from 97.1 to 96.9% for β-blockers. Predictors of incomplete prescription of guideline medications at discharge were female sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.54, p = 0.007), active or former smoker status (OR 2.29, p = 0.017), multivessel disease (OR 2.07, p = 0.022), left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% (OR 2.49, p = 0.008), and transfer to cardiac surgery (OR 9.66, p = 0.018). At 1 year, age > 65 (OR 1.92, p = 0.036) remained the only significant predictor.The present study showed a high prescription rate of guideline-recommended medications in a referral center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. At discharge, women and co-morbid patients were at the highest risk of incomplete prescription of guideline medications, whereas long-term prescription was suboptimal for elderly. A drug lacking at time of discharge was rarely introduced within the year, which underscores the paramount importance of optimal prescription at time of discharge. Strategies like implementing a standardized prescription could reduce the proportion of suboptimal prescription. It could therefore be one way to improve the long-term quality of care of our patients to the highest level.

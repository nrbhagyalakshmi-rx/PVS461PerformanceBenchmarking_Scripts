After an overnight fast, the volunteers were administered an oral dose of 1 g of paracetamol, urine was collected up to 8 h and samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography for the estimation of urinary recovery of paracetamol and its metabolites, i.e. sulphate, glucuronide, cysteine and mercapturate conjugates. 25.29 +/- 5.5 (mean +/- S.D.)% of sulphate conjugate, 60.55 +/- 8.5% of glucuronide conjugate, 5.05 +/- 2.1% of unchanged paracetamol, 2.76 +/- 2.4% of cysteine conjugate and 6.37 +/- 3.8% of mercapturate conjugate were recovered. The mean combined recovery of glutathione conjugates (9.13%) in Indians is found to be very high and is equal to that in Caucasians of Scotland (9.3%), which indicates that Indians are equally predisposed to hepatotoxicity as Caucasians.","execConfigId":18900,"isReviewed":false,"comment":"Bulk comment added by Vamsi","isAttachment":true,"signal":[{"name":"test_signal(S)","signalId":10025}]}],"filters":[{"value":"Validated Observation","closed":false,"isClosed":false}]}

The identified secondary metabolites in the investigated strains belonged to diketopiperazine (group of roquefortines, rugulosuvin B), benzodiazepine (anacin, cyclopenins), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatins), clavine ergot alkaloids (α-cyclopiazonic acid, festuclavine, fumigaclavines), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B, chaetoglobosin A), amino acid derivatives (N-acetyltryptamine, chrysogins, penicillin G), polyketides (citreoviridin A, mycophenolic acid), and terpenes (andrastins, phomenone). Strains isolated from anthropogenically altered habitats produced a more complete and characteristic profile of exometabolites, as compared with strains isolated from undisturbed habitats. It is only from contaminated soils there were isolated fungi that produced more structurally diverse secondary metabolites pertaining to polycyclic indole alkaloids and terpenoids. The fungi isolated from contaminated samples can be used in biodegradation of oil spills and bioremediation of the environment, and also as producers of promising biologically active compounds.","execConfigId":1456549,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":1456728,"alertName":"Perf_Lit","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of meningococcal isolates in Tunis, Tunisia: High diversity and impact on vaccination strategies.","authors":"[A, Brik][A, Terrade][E, Hong][A, Deghmane][M K, Taha][A, Bouafsoun][M, Khmiri][K, Boussetta][S, Boukhir][N Ben, Jaballah][A, Kechrid][H, Smaoui]","assignedTo":{"id":6979,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PENICILLIN G","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":1456283,"articleId":"31756567","articleAbstract":"The aim of this study was to characterize Neisseria meningitidis (Men) isolates in Tunisian paediatric patients with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in order to target therapeutic and preventive strategies.Fifty-nine isolates of Men and four cerebrospinal fluid samples that were culture-negative but Men-positive by PCR (NC-MenPPCR) (2009-2016) were collected from IMD patients.

Coverage of Men serogroup B (MenB) was determined by Genetic Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (gMATS) and fHbp expression by ELISA.MenB was the predominant type (88.9%). The majority of isolates (81%) had reduced susceptibility to penicillin G with altered penA alleles. The clonal complex CC461 (27.1%) was the most frequent. Among the MenB vaccine targets neisserial heparin binding antigen (NHBA) and fHbp, the predominant variants were NHBA118 (30.8%) and fHbp peptide 47 (25%), respectively. The nadA gene was present in 17.3% of isolates. Using gMATS, 36.5% of MenB were predicted to be covered by the 4CMenB vaccine.

This work aims at examining the antibacterial activity of alcoholic extract of black grape seeds (Vitis vinifera) against biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Staphylococcal bacterial isolates were first clinically confirmed using the VITEK-2compact system (ID and AST), and four isolates were selected depending on virulence and resistance to different types of antibiotics. The ability of S. aureus and S. haemolyticus isolates to form biofilm was examined using a standardized 96-well microtiter plate method. Furthermore, the effect of Moxifloxacin and Penicillin G with MIC, sub-MIC and sub-sub-MIC in preventing S. aureus and S. haemolyticus biofilm production, as well as that of the grape seed extract (180 mg/ml) were tested against biofilm formation. Our data indicate that all of the Staphylococcal bacterial isolates were able to produce biofilm which was prevented by the methanolic extracts of the crude seeds of Vitis vinifera rich in galloylated catechin esters of gallic acid. A significant (P < 0.001) synergistic effect between Penicillin G, Moxifloxacin with MIC, sub-MIC and sub-sub-MIC and that of the methanolic extract of Vitis vinifera (180 mg/ml) against bacterial biofilm formation was also detected.

Our analysis captured a wide range of barriers that may undermine timely use of health services for childhood skin infections. These included general factors that illustrate the importance of cultural competency amongst healthcare providers, patient-centred care and community engagement. Relating specifically to health service utilisation for childhood skin infections, we identified their apparent normalisation and the common use of painful benzathine penicillin G injections for their treatment as important barriers.

In an effort to elucidate this enigma, the authors analyzed, from a statistical and clinical significance perspective, seven current systematic reviews that address this concern. Hypothesis testing often does not provide clear understanding regarding the efficacy of the administration of antibiotics in association with clinical implantations. Therefore, number needed to treat (NNT) calculations may be used to determine the effectiveness of antibiotics to reduce dental implant losses. The NNT indicates how many additional patients need to be treated with antibiotics to avoid an additional implant failure in another patient. This article addresses two questions: Do antibiotics help reduce implant loss, and if they do, what is the best drug dosage to use when placing dental implants? Based on NNT calculations, the data is interpreted to denote that adjunctive antibiotics help reduce early implant loss in systemically healthy patients who are not receiving bone grafts and that 2 gm of amoxicillin prior to implant placement in non-allergic patients appears to be a satisfactory drug dose that provides a clinically significant benefit.","execConfigId":1456549,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":1456739,"alertName":"Perf_Lit","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Prevalence and Antibiotic Resistance Profiles of Staphylococcus Spp Isolated From Food, Food Contact Surfaces and Food Handlers in a Moroccan Hospital Kitchen.","authors":"[Ghita, BenjellounTouimi][Laila, Bennani][Sanae, Berrada][Moussa, Benboubker][Bahia, Bennani]","assignedTo":{"id":6979,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"26-Jan-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PENICILLIN G","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":1456283,"articleId":"31984518","articleAbstract":"Food poisoning risk related to the consumption of contaminated food with known foodborne pathogens or antibiotic-resistant bacteria is currently a serious threat for public health.

A total of 608 collected samples including 300 food samples, 238 food contact surfaces and 70 nasal and hand samples were tested. The identified Staphylococcus and their antibiotic resistance patterns were analyzed using the agar disk diffusion and PCR method was used for mecA resistance gene amplification. The prevalence of S. aureus and the Coagulase negative Staphylococci were 17.33% and 23.33% respectively. The antibiotic resistance reached 100% toward Oxacillin and Penicillin G for both S.aureus and CoNs. The mecA gene was detected in 5.71% (4/70) and 7.69% (4/52) of S.aureus and CoNs strains respectively. The outcome of this study enlightens isolation of MRSA strains and resistant CoNs from food, food contact surfaces and food handlers. The presence of this resistant species in this critical setting, where products were intended to vulnerable and immunocompromised patients, represent a serious threat to this community.

Methods Medical records of all identified cases of mushroom poisoning admitted during the period between 2015 and 2018 were extracted and patients' demographic data including age, sex, latency period, season of poisoning, clinical presentations, laboratory findings, prognosis, duration of hospitalization and therapeutic interventions were recorded. Results A total of 65 mushroom poisoning cases were identified (mean age of 35.68 years), of which 32 (49.2%) were females. Latency of ≤ 6 hours was seen in 63 (96.4%) cases. The most prevalent season of intoxication was spring (60.7%). The most frequent symptoms were nausea and vomiting (86.5%) and abdominal pain (51.2%). No case required intensive care unit (ICU) care or mechanical ventilation. Mean hospital stay was 1.89 days without any mortality. Mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 21.89 (±9.55), but the disturbance of liver function tests (LFTs), coagulopathy, elevated level of bilirubin and/or platelet was not noted. In 93% of patients ranitidine, in 7% Penicillin G, and in 3.6% cefaclor and ceftriaxone was administrated. Conclusion People and health care providers must be educated about mushroom poisoning. Prompt transfer of suspicious cases with history of wild mushroom ingestion to the emergency department is crucial since patients showing toxicity symptoms after 6 hours might have worse and mortal prognosis despite treatment.","execConfigId":1456549,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":1456737,"alertName":"Perf_Lit","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"Are nontreponemal tests suitable for monitoring syphilis treatment efficacy?

Identifying who needs antibiotics is challenging; microbiological confirmation and clinical scores are used but have limitations. In a cross-sectional study nested within a randomized controlled trial, we estimated the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients presenting to primary care with a sore throat and fever in northern Thailand. We then evaluated the use of C-reactive protein (CRP) and clinical scores (Centor and FeverPAIN) to identify the presence of GAS. One hundred sixty-nine patients were enrolled, of whom 35 (20.7%) had β-hemolytic Streptococci (BHS) isolated from throat swab culture, and 11 (6.5%) had GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to penicillin G. The median CRP of those without BHS isolation was 10 mg/L (interquartile range [IQR] ≤ 8-18), compared with 18 mg/L (IQR 9-71, P = 0.0302) for those with GAS and 14 mg/L (IQR ≤ 8-38, P = 0.0516) for those with any BHS isolated. However, there were no significant relationships between CRP > 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor ≥ 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN ≥ 4 (P = 1.000), and the diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. Identifying who requires antibiotics for pharyngitis remains challenging and necessitates further larger studies. C-reactive protein testing alone, although imperfect, can reduce prescribing compared with routine care. Targeted CRP testing through clinical scoring may be the most cost-effective approach to ruling out GAS infection.","execConfigId":1456549,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]},{"id":1456752,"alertName":"Perf_Lit","priority":{"value":"Urgent","iconClass":"mdi mdi-alpha-u-circle red-1"},"title":"A fructan from Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge showing neuroprotective and immunoregulatory effects.","authors":"[Shaojie, Zhang][Qi, Zhang][Lijun, An][Jiaojiao, Zhang][Zhengguo, Li][Jie, Zhang][Yuhao, Li][Muhetaer, Tuerhong][Yasushi, Ohizumi][Jin, Jin][Jing, Xu][Yuanqiang, Guo]","assignedTo":{"id":6979,"fullName":"bhagya","username":"bhagya","email":"NR.Bhagyalakshmi@rxlogix.com"},"publicationDate":"01-Feb-2020","disposition":"New","productName":"PENICILLIN G","eventName":null,"actionCount":0,"isValidationStateAchieved":false,"alertTags":[],"alertConfigId":1456283,"articleId":"31826524","articleAbstract":"A novel polysaccharide, AAP70-1, was isolated from Anemarrhena asphodeloides for the first time.

In this study, we analysed the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of ampicillin on the morphology, growth and survival of L. monocytogenes. The non-inhibitory concentration (NIC), the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the MIC/NIC ratio were determined. Gram and Live/Dead staining showed aggregates of L. monocytogenes cells when grown at subinhibitory concentrations of ampicillin, with >90% of viable cells. The L. monocytogenes strains tested showed an intermediate heteroresistance to ampicillin, characterised by a MIC/NIC ratio of 4. Our results seem to indicate that both intermediate heteroresistance and the formation of aggregates could play a role in the clinical failure of ampicillin in the treatment of CNS infections caused by L. monocytogenes. However, more studies are necessary to elucidate this question.","execConfigId":1456549,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false}]}

Comparison of the fungal complexes showed them to differ by species composition; only two species-P. palitans and P. solitum-were in the species lists of both groups. The identified secondary metabolites in the investigated strains belonged to diketopiperazine (group of roquefortines, rugulosuvin B), benzodiazepine (anacin, cyclopenins), quinoline alkaloids (viridicatins), clavine ergot alkaloids (α-cyclopiazonic acid, festuclavine, fumigaclavines), polycyclic indole alkaloids (communesin B, chaetoglobosin A), amino acid derivatives (N-acetyltryptamine, chrysogins, penicillin G), polyketides (citreoviridin A, mycophenolic acid), and terpenes (andrastins, phomenone). Strains isolated from anthropogenically altered habitats produced a more complete and characteristic profile of exometabolites, as compared with strains isolated from undisturbed habitats. It is only from contaminated soils there were isolated fungi that produced more structurally diverse secondary metabolites pertaining to polycyclic indole alkaloids and terpenoids. The fungi isolated from contaminated samples can be used in biodegradation of oil spills and bioremediation of the environment, and also as producers of promising biologically active compounds.","execConfigId":1456549,"isReviewed":false,"comment":null,"isAttachment":false,"signal":[]}],"filters":[{"value":"New","closed":false,"isClosed":false}]}
